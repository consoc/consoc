# More about Glastonbury Conservation Society

It is somewhat startling to calculate how long the Conservation Society has been doing its bit for Glastonbury.
It is more than 15% of the tercentenary that the town recently celebrated: 48 out of the now 315 years.

The society was formed in haste in 1971 in order to save the Crown Hotel in the central Market Place from being pulled down, as had several interesting medieval buildings nearby; swift spot-listing saved a number of other sites too.
Today [the Crown survives](/newsletter/articles/100/crown/) as a building but is currently awaiting a new owner.

Another Conservation Society project was to rescue some of Glastonbury’s pre-Beeching heritage: [the canopy from the railway station](/newsletter/articles/050/history1/#canopy), by relocating it (ironically?) amid parked cars in the main central carpark, where it makes two acres of asphalt easier on the eye.
The trees in the carparks are the society’s work too.

Today, Glastonbury Conservation Society:

- obtains copies of all planning applications and exercises the right to comment
- plants trees in town and 10 miles around: 51,800 trees in 48 years!
- hears interesting talks from experts on various aspects of our environment
- publishes a newsletter (approx quarterly).

[Civic Voice](http://civicvoice.org.uk) is the national body set up in 2010 as an umbrella group for local societies promoting civic pride all over Britain.

> We work to make the places where everyone lives more attractive, enjoyable and distinctive and to promote civic pride.
> We speak up for civic societies and local communities across England.

These are some of the current Civic Voice campaigns:

- Alliance of cathedral cities and historic towns
- Big Conservation Conversation
- Civic Day
- Local Heritage List
- Save our high streets
- Street clutter
- War memorials. A previous campaign challenged the government’s proposals to loosen the planning process in favour of developers.

*Civic Sense* is the online newsletter published monthly by Civic Voice, with links to civic societies around the country and what they’re doing.

(Glastonbury Conservation Society has not yet joined Civic Voice, but several of our counterpart societies in nearby towns are members of the national body: Frome, Midsomer Norton, Warminster, Taunton, Bath, …)
