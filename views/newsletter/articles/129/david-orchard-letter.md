I was interested in the letter from Roger
Lord of Leeds in Newsletter 128. My
recollection of Mr Cullen’s daughters is
the same! (But I was only 12.)

He mentions his
“Uncle Lou”, Walter Louis
Day, as a bellringer at St
John’s, and asks for
information. The
Glastonbury Antiquarian Society has a
record of the St John’s ringers, which I
will consult, and if Walter Day is listed
I will photocopy the entries and send
them to Mr Lord.

Thanks for the summary of my
heraldry talk (in the same issue). It was
a good precis, considering the length of
my talk. I should have made two
sessions of it!

There is one major error, however,
about the royal arms as displayed on the
Pilgrims Inn. These are the arms of
Edward the *Fourth*, not Edward III. I
should hate to think anyone thought I
attributed Edward III’s reign to the
“15th or early 16th century” as quoted.
He died in 1377, and the murder of his
grandson Richard II in 1400 led to the
outbreak of the Wars of the Roses.
Edward IV was the Yorkist king (you
can see the white roses on the Pilgrims
Inn) who died in 1483, and his brother
Richard III, who assumed the throne
from Edward’s son Edward V (elder of
the two “princes in the Tower”) was
killed by Henry, Earl of Richmond, at
the Battle of Bosworth in 1485,
establishing the Tudor
dynasty.

Thus, to say that these
arms date from “the late
15th or early 16th century”
is incorrect. Edward IV had been dead
for 17 years at the start of the 16th
century, and the Tudors had been on the
throne for 15. The Tudors were not in
the business of advertising the House of
York (though Henry VII did marry
Elizabeth of York to unite the houses).
