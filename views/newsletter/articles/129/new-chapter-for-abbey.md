Not only does Glastonbury Abbey have a
new trust deed, but it has many new
faces among the trustees. Several chose
to retire this year, and several have to
retire because they have reached age 75.

Moreover, Matthew Clements is
retiring as custodian in October. The
position is being advertised.

There are now 14 trustees. All are
appointed by the bishop, and include
ex-officio the vicar of Glastonbury, the
archdeacon, the chairman of the diocesan
board of finance and the diocesan
education director.

The original Glastonbury Abbey
Estate trust deed from 1908 was “worded
in a nebulous way that didn’t make
precisely clear what we could or could
not do as a charitable trust,” said Susan
Strong, the Abbey’s education officer.

The new Glastonbury Abbey Trust
has stronger links with the diocese,
though wording has been moderated: the
old deed specified that trustees must be
in communion with the Church of
England; the new wording is more like
“in sympathy” with the church. “We try
to retain an opening and welcoming
approach to everybody,” Susan said, “but
there are restrictions to do with
alternative forms of worship, because the
precincts remain consecrated ground.”
