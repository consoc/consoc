Names and dates of bellringers dating back into the 19th century were
revealed when paint was recently stripped from the doors of the clock
cupboard in St John's church tower.

Among the names carved in the wood are H<sup>Y</sup> Rice 1874, Job Parfitt Mar
10th 1871, R. Masters May 1860, W. Cane, J. Bryant, J. Bond. You can
probably find more names in the photo.

The walls of the bellringing chamber are lined with elm panelling made
from the old Georgian box pews [which furnished the church until a
Victorian renovation].

Conducted tours up the tower take place on occasions such as church
fetes. For current dates, see the [St John's
website](http://stjohns-glastonbury.org.uk).
