The Peat Moors Centre, near Shapwick,
is to close permanently at the end of
October, a victim of the county’s budget
cuts. A Roman legion arrives on October
31 (10am to 4pm) to symbolically close
the Celtic settlement.

During August, however, various
activities and days out are on offer:

- a living history display about the Parisii
  iron-age tribe (Saturday 1)
- demonstrations of Celtic crafts (Sun 2)
  and of willow basket-making (Sunday 24
  and Monday 31).

And in September:

- an ancient Norwegian saga performed
  by the storyteller Jem Dick (Saturday 12)
- flint-knapping demos (Saturday 19)
- a “wild day out” on Sunday 27: the
  Avalon marshes in summer, quizzes and
  environmental activities for children of
  all ages.
