Bushy Coombe must be one of the
town’s most visited beauty spots, having
a made-up footpath to the Tor that avoids
the now dangerous alternative alongside
the A361. Its owners, Rory Weightman
and his wife Mani, live at the top of the
coombe in the converted barn or coach
house, which is listed Grade 2 and was at
one time considered “at risk”.

Recent works by our society include
more tree guards and maintenance at a
nearby orchard. The town council put up
a standard-design bin for dog litter.

At Bushy Coombe Gardens, off
Bovetown, a recent planning application
for a rear balcony was passed, although
recommended for refusal on grounds of
overlooking. Councillors debated that
overlooking already existed, not least
from the public footpath across the
coombe, and also that later houses built
at the side of Edmund Hill had balconies
and were in the Regency tradition of
Clifton and Bath in this respect.

Bushy Coombe is run as a nature
reserve with resident badgers, visiting
deer and a range of birds including
buzzards. Bramble bushes have been
allowed to grow, which in turn protects
wildlife. While sapling trees have grown
up, uncontrolled growth of brambles will
reduce wildflowers such as vetches,
which support Blue butterflies. A
balance is necessary, so some clearance
will take place.

Cows graze during the summer and
have their calves, adding to the pastoral
scene, with views up to the Tor and back
across the town to the coast and beyond.
