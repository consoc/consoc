\[Newsletters [126](/newsletter/articles/#newsletter-126) and [127](/newsletter/articles/#newsletter-127) had articles
about a Glastonbury medallion found in
a garden in Hampshire.\]

</aside>

Some 40 years ago I found a similar
medallion in a desk drawer, bearing the
heads of the king and queen, the town
coat of arms and mayor’s name,
commemorating a visit to Middleton (or
passing through) early last century. It
too had a hole roughly pierced in it. As
there are 22 Middletons in my English
atlas (not all large), I had to resort to the
librarian of Windsor Castle to establish
which area and towns HM had visited at
the time. They revealed that the visit
had been to Lancashire, and I was able
to pinpoint the town.

The librarian also provided
photocopies of similar medallions
depicted in a catalogue (Spinks, I
believe)—which indicated that there are
collectors of these objects.

The town clerk of Middleton, Lancs,
was pleased to accept my find, to place
in the town’s archive. It would appear it
was common practice for town councils
to celebrate a royal occasion by
presenting such memorabilia to each
householder or ratepayer. No doubt
there was a bit of mayoral vanity to boot.

Aluminium was not a common
metal and somewhat a novelty; usefully,
it was soft and dies could be made
cheaply.

Glastonbury council’s minutes of
business before 1911 would record the
council’s intentions.
