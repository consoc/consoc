Many will know that St Benedict’s is
entering momentous times. The church is
to have a much-needed facelift within the
next few years, thanks to monies received
from the sale of the church hall. With the
installation of modern kitchen facilities,
better access for the disabled and a general
rationalization of the body of the
church, it is hoped that this
beautiful building will become a
more obviously welcoming
venue for those who wish to take
advantage of its unique
atmosphere as a place of prayer.

St Ben’s was founded as the
Church of St Benignus in the late
11th century, then greatly
enlarged and embellished in the
time of the penultimate Abbot,
Richard Bere. Richard Bere’s
stamp is to be seen everywhere,
from his Bishop’s mitre and monogram
over the north porch, to the original roof
corbels in the nave.

The church possesses some fine
stained glass, much of it installed in
Victorian times when a south aisle was
added. One in particular is dedicated to
Reginald Porch, who died in India
possibly never having seen his yet-to-be
famous son, Monty, who married Winston
Churchill’s mother Jennie.

Perhaps an even more famous son of
St Ben’s was the novelist Henry Fielding,
who was born at Sharpham Park in 1707.
The baptism of Henry’s younger sisters at
St Benedict’s is recorded, but the register
for Henry’s early years is sadly missing.
Sharpham was built by that busy Abbot
Bere—hence the Sharpham
Chapel in St Benedict’s,
which has housed the organ
since the early 19th century.

Recent happenings
include the discovery of rare
sheet music: poems by Alice
Buckton set to music by
Frederic Brooks for the
Glastonbury Pageant of 1921.
The same cupboard
held some of Brooks’ own
liturgical compositions from
a decade or so earlier. The
originals are now housed safely in the
County Record Office, but copies are
available to those who would like them.

The church is serious in its wish to be
more accessible, opening its doors more
and more, to schoolchildren from across
the road and to the visitor from far and
near. It will not take them long to find the
newest addition—a fine bust sculpted by a
local artist, Richard Field, and dedicated
to St Benedict.
