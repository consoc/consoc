Heritage Fine Foods in the High Street
will become a Co-op store overnight on
August 20, but its two dozen staff will be
unchanged except for new uniforms.

Peter Trinder began the business in
1986\. At first he used the name Nisa,
after his supplier, Northern Independent
Supermarkets Association, and renamed
it Heritage in 1996 after Mendip’s
shopfront scheme helped to transform
the brutal exterior of the 1960s building.

Radstock Co-op had apparently been
eyeing the shop for some while, and when
Mr Trinder wanted to retire the Co-op
made an offer he couldn’t refuse. The
Glastonbury store will be the ninth in a
group owned by Radstock Co-op.

“Radstock is a local society, and
that’s what attracted me,” Mr Trinder
said. “They’re ethical, and they’ll look
after the staff.”
