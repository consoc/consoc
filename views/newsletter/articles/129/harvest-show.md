You’re invited to display your produce at
the Glastonbury Harvest Show, on
**September 19** this year, again at the
Town Hall. The idea of harvest is
extended to include local sustainable
goods and activities.

“We’d love to hear from local
amateur enthusiasts who might like to
demonstrate their crafts. Beer-makers,
wine-makers, rag-rugging—all ideas
welcome,” said Trish O’Carroll, one of
the organizers ([83 5810](tel:+441458835810)).
