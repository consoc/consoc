The Abbey Barn as usual has all sorts of
activities on offer, August to October:
demonstrations of lacemaking, stick
weaving, spinning, rag rugs, weaving,
braid weaving, cidermaking and cooking
with apples. There’s even a session
entitled “Try your hand at Victorian
laundry”. There are also farmhouse teas
that you learn to cook yourself, a talk
about the Women’s Land Army, a visit
by the Duke of Monmouth’s garrison,
and a Henry VIII impersonator doing
Henry’s Horrid History.

Meanwhile, watercolours by Lucy
Willis are on display throughout August.
The September–October exhibitions are
“Prints, pots and chairs” (by Print
Southwest, Rodney Lawrence and
Elizabeth Raeburn, Lorraine Houlden)
and “Portraits of the Somerset carnivals”
(Terry Flaxton).
