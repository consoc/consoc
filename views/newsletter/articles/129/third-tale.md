A tale similar to the two above could soon
be told about Keith Taylor. He wants to
build three striking eco-houses, all with
four bedrooms and gardens plus solar
panels and heat-exchangers, on land he
owns adjacent to the Abbey wall—the
site of the former Clarks printing works
at 3A Magdalene Street.

Planning officers recommended
refusal. They cited government
guidelines wanting higher-density
housing and suggested Mr Taylor should
build nine two-bedroom units—for
which planning permission already
existed. (A previous owner went out of
business before starting to build them.)

“Glastonbury is already saturated
with two-bedroom flats crammed into
tiny sites. I think they’re using us as a
dumping ground,” Mr Taylor said. “I
must be the only builder in history that
wants to put less on a site, not more. I
wanted these houses, on this site beside
the Abbey, to make a statement.”

The application went before a
committee of councillors. They approved
it on July 22, with conditions about
insulation and exterior materials.

The houses will use timber panels
constructed in Cornwall and then erected
quickly in Glastonbury as a weatherproof
shell for interior work to continue. “Each
house will have such insulation properties
that you can run it for practically nothing.
That’s one of my reasons for doing this
project: it will be totally eco-friendly,”
Mr Taylor said.

Keith and Julia Taylor have lived in
Glastonbury for six years. Their current
home is Naish House in Magdalene
Street, the Regency house which he
restored in 2008. The former Priory
House was built before 1825 for Sarah
and Anna Greenhill Naish, who used the
Abbot’s Kitchen (owned by their brother,
the attorney William Benjamin Naish).
From 1903 the house was the St Louis
convent and then part of Millfield’s pre-prep school. Mr Taylor reconverted it to
two large dwellings: Naish House at the
front and Greenhill House behind, with its
grand ballroom. \[Newsletters [123](/newsletter/articles/#newsletter-123),

This project won him the Mendip
Built in Quality award this year for the
best domestic conversion in Mendip.
Will his three new houses across the
street, rejected and now approved,
eventually win another award?
