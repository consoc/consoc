With a fascinating array of maps and
prints, Neill Bonham portrayed the
evolution of early Victorian Glastonbury
to the Antiquarian Society on April 3.

Medieval survivals were still
plentiful in the Regency period. The
Boundary Commission map of 1835
showed how little the built-up parts of
the town had expanded. However,
dramatic changes came by the time of
the Tithe Map in 1844: grand houses
such as Chalice Hill House, Abbey
House, Somerset House and Blenheim
House all appeared. The row of cottages
between St John’s and the High Street
was cleared away, and the cross by
Benjamin Ferrey in the Market Place
was erected in 1846.

West’s sketchbook of 1844, kept in
the Victoria & Albert Museum, contains
numerous vignettes of the town, including
the “Madras” school beside St John’s.
The sale of the Abbey site in 1850 (to
James Austin) occasioned the printing of
a booklet of views by Dolby, giving
excellent detail and descriptions.

In the campaign in 1854 to save the
canal a poster showed the canal basin
and its environs, and several engravings
appeared with an article in the *Illustrated
London News* recording the celebrations
when the railway opened the same year.

Early directories such as Hunts
detailed the numerous coach connections
through Glastonbury. The White Hart in
particular concentrated on this trade,
which by the early 1850s was but a pale
shadow of former times.

A tourists’ booklet of engraved views
around 1855, in many ways a forerunner
of the picture postcard, provides several
views of the town that reveal recent
developments in detail, such as the
remodelling of the interior of St John’s,
with the new font and pulpit by Sir
Gilbert Scott and gasoliers. St Benedict’s
was as yet unrestored (again by Scott).
Another view shows the newly erected
cemetery chapels.

Neill plans to continue his review of
Victorian Glastonbury in autumn lectures.
