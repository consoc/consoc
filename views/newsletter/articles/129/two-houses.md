In this year’s Built in Quality awards,
Michael Eavis won the accolade for the
best single new house. The Eavis design,
next to the Tithe Barn in Pilton, was built
in a “traditional style” with oak timbers
to echo the important listed barn
(recently re-roofed).

Problems arose when he departed
from his permission brief and
incorporated new features “as his ideas
evolved”. He was then required to apply
for retrospective planning permission,
and the matter came before the planning
board. The planning officer, backed by
English Heritage, recommended refusal,
largely on the grounds of the introduction
of “nonvernacular alien features”.

While deploring the retrospective
aspect, I considered the house as then
built to be “worthy of permission”; I
pointed out that two of our fine historic
buildings of merit such as St John’s
church tower, which is in the Gloucestershire tradition, and the Abbot’s Kitchen,
which is French in style, incorporate
alien features and are admired.

Permission was granted and, as stated,
Mr Eavis has now received an award!

A “highly commended” went to
Rodney Gifford. He had long dreamed of
a retirement home in the garden of Little
Orchard, his 1930s house at the end of
Ashwell Lane. Unfortunately he allowed
his outline planning permission to lapse
and had to reapply. This time it was
recommended for refusal on highway
grounds: increased traffic flow at the
dangerous A361 junction.

It was, however, pointed out that
several bed-and-breakfast outlets already
operated in Ashwell Lane, and as a
percentage of overall vehicle movements
the extra was insignificant. Permission
was granted, and the new house now
incorporates “highly commended”
retirement features. (Incidentally, the
builder’s name is Brunsdon—one of the
clan, no doubt, but not a close relative!)

The annual Built in Quality Awards
are run by Mendip council, and the
presentation took place in spring at the
Town Hall. *(Full list on Mendip website.)*

Each has a wall blocking the ground floor windows from view. The protruding section of each house is unique in terms of roof shape. The left two have a circular window in the centre; the one on the right has no window on this section of the building. Behind, a line is visible describing a wall running behind the buildings.">

Nº3 Magdalene Street, behind a row of terraced houses. Roofs are zinc, and the exterior walls
are cedar and render. This view is from the Magdalene Street direction. <span class="ednote">(Heriz-Payne architects)</span>
