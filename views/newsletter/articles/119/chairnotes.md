The Local Development Framework (LDF) is at its consultative stage
towards establishing what amounts to the Local Plan for the next 20
years. Taken stage by stage, it will need to be accepted as “sound”.
Challengers will have to prove the plan “unsound”.

Already it appears that Glastonbury is “developed out”, and after the
completion of the two estates to the east of the town there may be no
further major development. Future housing needs may have to be met in
Street.

Now is your opportunity to put ideas forward as to how the town should
develop. A study of the existing Mendip-wide plan will reveal the
present development area. Some members of the public were surprised to
find land alongside Roman Way on the lower slope of Wearyall had been
included since the 1960s. Remaining Glastonbury land is either of high
amenity value or near the flood plain and may never be built over.

The Environment Agency’s revised map showing the once-in-100-years
floodplain includes all of the Morlands site and much other land already
built over. It is a sobering thought that the tsunami of 1607 reached St
Benedict’s Church.

Baker Associates, a specialist planning consultancy firm, is advising
Mendip council.

### William Stansell awards

The Somerset Building Preservation Trust
has informed the town clerk that the restoration of the Betrothal Couple
medieval corbals and the 19th-century Market Cross have been shortlisted
for conservation awards. Inspection is on June 20.

### Frome landmarks

Frome Festival is celebrating 25 years of grant aid
for historic buildings in Frome. As vice-chair of Mendip council, I
shall chair an invitation-only event on July 16 to launch a celebratory
publication. There will be presentations by Kevin McCloud and Bob Ladd.
