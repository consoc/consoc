Martin Oliver gave a well prepared, informative and most interesting
talk illustrated by slides to an audience somewhat reduced by clashing
November activities. He concentrated on the lead and associated silver
extraction in the Charterhouse, Harptree, Green Ore and Priddy areas.

The region had been of importance from prehistory: traders transported
lead as far as the ancient temple at Jerusalem. Mendip was the most
important source of lead in the Roman empire. The Romans organized this
premier industry with a mining town at Charterhouse complete with fort
and amphitheatre, and probably a road to the coastal port at Ubley.
Several inscribed “pigs” of lead have been found.

There were periods of greater activity, ending in the 19th century when
old slag and alluvial slime was recycled for secondary extraction. Apart
from the Charterhouse area, Velvet Bottom settlement beds and the
Harptree chimney, there are few other signs apart from low slag heaps
and acres of gruffy ground. Mining was never by deep shaft and probably
started with surface deposits.
