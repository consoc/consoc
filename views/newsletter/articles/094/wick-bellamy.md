The Old Oaks caravan and camp site at Wick Farm — named for Gog and
Magog, trees possibly two millennia old on the farm — won a conservation
award from David Bellamy. He judges the contest personally, studying
thorough reports from independent assessors who visit sites with
checklists. They consider how well designed the site is in conjunction
with its environment and look out for extra touches such aas birdboxes.
More trees, ground cover, low-voltage lighting and recycled litter are
among items checked. Rather than cash, the prize is prestige — a strong
selling point for the park to put in its brochure.

The Old Oaks also won the Calor Gas award in December for the most
improved park in England. Judges were impressed by underground cabling
leaving uninterrupted views, wildflower areas, a Victorian reed-bed
sewage system and a “delightful fishpond in a natural setting which
enhances the peacefulness of the park as a whole.” The owners, Jim and
Sally White and their four sons, will use the £1,000 prize for more work
on the pond area, further planting to encourage wildlife, and
highlighting natural features in the dog-walk area.
