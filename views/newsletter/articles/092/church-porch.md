Work is underway to restore and clean the front and inside of the porch
at St John’s Church, particularly the damaged stone seats. Ken Ellis
conservators, of Shepton Mallet, are doing the work, which is funded by
the Friends of St John’s. Work is also taking place to save two
little-seen crosses at the back of the church.

Alan Tarbat, in his guidebook *Let’s Walk Round Glastonbury*, writes:

> In the churchyard is one of the holy thorns that “blossom at
> Christmas, mindful of Our Lord.” Behind the building (north wall) are
> two “mortuary crosses” — crucifixes really — one fairly distinct, the
> other all but obliterated. The former is at the bottom of the
> rood-loft stairway, the latter on the north side of the tower. Readers
> (and who dare not be?) of Craik’s *Last Abbot of Glastonbury* will

> too prophetic vision of the “fetches” on All Hallow E’en.

Alan Tarbat, sadly no longer with us, wrote his guidebook during World
War II. It is full of interest for the conservationist. It was reprinted
and revised several times by the old Glastonbury Advertising Association
but is now out of print.

The final paragraph reads:

> Glastonbury is the mother of saints. Everyone knows that. But others
> have tried to foist on to her their bastard children, Sloth,
> Slatternliness and Sentimentality: and her skirts have indeed been
> soiled. Yet a Venetian blind (hideous monstrosity that it is) cannot
> fail to let in some sun: and the beauty of magic-named Avalon succeeds
> in pushing through everything. Glastonbury is still “the holyest
> earthe in England”.
