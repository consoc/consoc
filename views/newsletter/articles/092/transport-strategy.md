This is the introduction to a report published for public consultation.
The report’s purpose is to provide the basis for informed debate on
transport issues and options in Glastonbury. The revised report will
then become the blueprint for transport initiatives within the town.

</aside>

In Somerset, as in other areas of the country, we are experiencing the
effects of increased traffic, which has risen approximately 50% over the
last ten years. The problems of congestion, road safety, pollution and a
general deterioration in road and environmental conditions are a direct
result of motor vehicles.

Building more capacity into the road network by providing alternative
routes is not a long-term solution to the traffic problem. Transport
policies are shifting towards strategies that focus on managing the
demand for the existing road space.

A transport strategy for Glastonbury has been developed which aims to
enhance the viability and vitality of the town and improve conditions
for the local community.

The Strategy concentrates on alternatives to the car and sets objectives
for improving the environment of those who live, visit, work and shop in
the town. It also proposes a hierarchy of modes of movement about the
town, with walking at the top and private cars at the bottom. The
Strategy includes a cycle network, which takes cyclists off road where
necessary, or onto streets that carry relatively low flows of traffic. A
signing review is proposed to encourage visitor traffic away from the
town centre. Seasonal traffic restrictions are proposed to restrict car
parking around the Tor and near the High Street, leaving it a safer and
more pleasant place to five, visit, work and shop. Lorries will be given
clear directions as to the times and routes for deliveries.

It is now recognized that the two issues of land use and transport are
interrelated. The aim of the Glastonbury Study has been to evolve a
strategy that integrates and balances these two important issues.

A transport plan for Glastonbury
--------------------------------

In December 1998, Somerset County Council and its partner WS Atkins
South West started work in partnership with Mendip District Council,
Glastonbury town council and other agencies, by forming a Steering Group
for a Transport Study of Glastonbury.

In January 1999, a “brainstorm” event was held at the Town Hall, with
representatives of interested parties informing the Steering Group of
transport issues and possible solutions in and wound the town. In
February 1999 a similar event was held at St John’s Centre, inviting the
general public to inform the Steering Group of their concerns and
possible solutions. This report considers the issues and solutions,
including others that have been identified, in order to form a Transport
Strategy.

This document sets out the objectives of the study. These objectives
have been formed according to Somerset County Council policies generated
by the Kyoto international agreement on pollution, and the government
initiative towards a sustainable transport system. It is important that
the solutions not only address the identified issues and problems, but
also help to deliver the objectives.

Policy background
-----------------

A programme of Town and Corridor Studies started in 1994. This programme
identified towns and transport corridors within the County for which it
was necessary to formulate the policies and strategies of land-use and
transport development to the year 2011.

The Transport Policies and Programme document, that has laid the
County’s case for funding in front of the government in the past, has
now been superseded. Its successor will rely on Transport Plans to
indicate to the government our intentions for transport expenditure
within the County in the years to come.

This Town Study promotes the transport policies and strategies as set
out in the County’s key policy documents (County Structure Plan, the
Public Transport Plan, County Cycling strategy). This will enable the
district and county councils to stand together at the Local Plan Inquiry
in the knowledge that the plans on show for Glastonbury reflect current
government transport policy and have been formulated with benefit of
public involvement and consultation.

Policies
--------

The policies contained within the Structure Plan Review are:

-   To co-ordinate land-use and transport policies to reduce the need to
    travel and the distances travelled
-   to identify measures which will reduce the impact of transport on
    the environment
-   to promote an integrated and balanced transport system
-   to aid the efficient functioning of the economy through improvements
    to the transport system
-   to enable people to gain access to the services that they need
-   to promote the safe transport of people and goods.

These policies and their implementation underpin the rationale of this
Town Study.

The Glastonbury Town Study has tried to:

-   identify how we can reduce car dependency
-   identify how we can reduce the need to travel by car, both the
    number and length of journeys
-   improve people’s awareness of a more sustainable lifestyle
-   show how a modal shift from the car, to walking, cycling, bus and
    train, can be achieved
-   take into account the needs of those without a car
-   take into account access for people with disabilities; and
-   identify the relationship between transport conditions and the local
    economy.

Setting the scene
-----------------

The population of Glastonbury rose by 15% between 1981 and 1991 to 7,747
according to the national census, which showed approximately a third of
the population was in employment and 50% of those worked outside the
town.

The 1991 census shows that only 20% of the population chose to drive to
work, therefore it can be assumed that the remaining traffic in
Glastonbury is made up of tourists, deliveries and local trips of
necessity. It is this traffic, mainly seasonal, that the strategy will
tackle.

We aim to encourage people to **walk** for their short trips. To
accomplish this, we will have to make our existing roads and streets as
safe and as pleasant to use as we possibly can, as well as provide new
pedestrian walkways. ...

For journeys that are too far to walk, **cycling** offers the best
alternative transport for shift away from motor car travel. It combines
an environmentally clean mode of travel with the personal health
benefits of regular exercise. It is substantially quicker than walking,
and may well be quicker than the car in the face of traffic congestion
at peak times.
