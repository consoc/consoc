<img src="../norbins-at-george.jpg" alt="A view along a street in black and white. A row of brick terraced houses is on the right, the closest of which has a pointed roof. At the far end, a chuch tower rises behind a house covered in ivy. Closer to the camera, in the right are metal railings before a T-junction in the road, and at this corner stands a black metal lamp post. On the left side of the road part of a tall house is visible, beyond which are some trees and a wall. The road is clear of people and vehicles.">

Another postcard view of Norbins Road, this one dated 1917 from the
Oldis collection. The end-of-terrace house (Number 31) on the right of
the photo is “Grosvenor House”, constructed by the builder, John
Barnett, for himself: it’s the biggest house in the road.

Not much has changed in the century since this last terrace, at upper
Norbins Road, was finished in 1899, except that the elegant gas lamp is
gone and overhead wires and a million parked cars have come.

Could we mark the centenary by paving the ugly alley (Church Lane,
leading to the church and the High Street) with brick and planting 100
trees?
