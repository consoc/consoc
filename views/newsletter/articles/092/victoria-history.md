A large audience assembled for the great privilege of hearing our
distinguished county historian, Dr Robert Dunning, tell about his
unpublished work on Glastonbury for the *Victoria County History*.

Started at Victoria’s jubilee
-----------------------------

He began his talk on April 26 by telling us how the histories
originated, just over 100 years ago, to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of
Queen Victoria. Prominent citizens such as Constable the publisher and
W.H. Smith the bookseller, in the hope of peerages, contributed
generously. The writers of the early volumes before the First World War
were interested mainly in the landed families and the extent and value
of their holdings, but they also mentioned the established church,
industries that were too noticeable to be ignored, and the more
prominent earthworks and prehistoric remains. Most archival material was
then still in private hands — so whether or not it was used was mere
chance or a matter of whom you knew and whether they had kept their
collection in reasonable order and condition. Two general volumes on
Somerset were published in 1906 and 1911; they sold for five guineas
each!

Between the wars the whole project languished, but in 1947 it began
again with the county of Wiltshire, which had enlightened and cultured
parish and borough councillors, leading the way in supporting the
project financially. Somerset did not get going till 1967 with Volume
III, which covered the Hundreds of Pitney, Somerton and Tintinhull and
was published in 1974; Volume IV, which covered Crewkerne, Martock and
South Petherton, was published a mere four years later, a great
achievement. Volume V on Williton, Watchet and Nether Stowey appeared in
1985, followed by Volume VI on Andersfield, Cannington and North
Petherton a few years later. Volume VII on Wincanton, Milborne Port and
Bruton would be available now if the publisher’s computer had not got
confused over footnotes and stuck them repetitively and at random!
Volume IX, on which Dr Dunning is now working, covers the area from West
Huntspill to West Pennard, which of course includes Glastonbury.

Abbey kept careful records
--------------------------

Because the monks kept such careful records the sheer volume of archival
material for Glastonbury is immense. Much of it is at Longleat, where
the charge for looking at it is £17 per day; most of it, however, is now
available on microfilm. There are also large collections in the British
Library and the Record Offices and still much, some of it unknown, in
private hands.

After the Dissolution the ownership of the Manor of Glastonbury became
extremely complicated. The Crown owned it but the Crown’s representative
who collected the rents from the lessees was known as the owner; the
lessees sublet to people who might sublet again to those who actually
farmed the land. Not only was the structure of ownership complicated but
the land was divided into a series of fractions which were not constant
divisions. Much of the later history of ownership is still in the
offices of solicitors — it is confidential and can be seen only with the
permission of the client to whom it pertains. Mrs Betty Harland, the
present Lady of the Manor of Glastonbury, has generously and most
usefully given this permission. At one time the area of Glastonbury Tor
was owned by Sir Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead, the famous
antiquarian.

Courts have a tangled history
-----------------------------

The history of the Glastonbury Courts was even more complicated. An
18th-century visitor described the people as “gross and illiterate” and
the magistrates as “quibbling” — all doubtless determined to prove their
rights by hook or by crook.

Dr Dunning told us that the church history was the most puzzling. He has
found the great Pevsner mistaken in his estimate of the amount of damage
done when the tower of St John’s fell down in the early 15th century,
and that the church did not have to be entirely rebuilt then. The tower,
however, is a Gloucestershire rather than a Somerset pattern. In the
19th century the famous architect Sir George Gilbert Scott was asked for
his advice about church repairs, but it was decided that his ideas were
too expensive and the council used its own man, Merrick. While the
church was undergoing repair, services were held in the Abbot’s Kitchen.

As we should expect, Dr Dunning is making numerous discoveries of all
kinds. For example, a Glastonbury document uses the word “quilt-maker” a
century before the date given by the Oxford English Dictionary for its
first use. Of more significance, Dr Dunning has discovered the meaning
of “Ponter’s Ball” — just what it was and why West Pennard has a “New
Town”.

Somers Square was behind a medieval building at the top of the High Street, next to the Queen&rsquo;s Head pub. David Orchard, who lived in Somers Square in the 1950s, annotated this old map.

Lecturer asks listeners
-----------------------

Our lecturer invited our help. Where was Somers Square? David Orchard
was able to tell him it had stood next to the Queen’s Head at the top of
the High Street, a medieval building with a courtyard of 19th-century
dwellings. It was replaced in the 1960s by Alves’ motor dealership and
later transformed into a supermarket — Anderson’s, then the Co-op till
Safeway supplanted it. Today, when not actually out of use, a small part
of the building is a factory outlet, sparse in goods and usually empty
of people. The site is an object lesson of what we have destroyed to no
purpose.

If any reader knows where Mount Pleasant is or was, Dr Dunning would be
glad to hear.

We are all deeply grateful to him for a talk which was as stimulating as
it was learned. The task of making such a wealth of detailed knowledge
palatable to the uninformed is not easy.
