I was making a career break. I had resigned from my work as a college
lecturer to go freelance. My house was nearly sold. My son had asked me
if I intended to buy another place in England. There was a family house
in France, and I had thought of basing myself there.

“Only if it’s a wing of this house, on the edge of a field, near
Glastonbury” — I love that particular style of Victorian Gothic
architecture, I love the English countryside, and I love Glastonbury,
where my family lived. I really meant “no” by putting forward an
unattainable ideal.

Two days later, the agent’s picture of Bushy Coombe came through the
door. It was an almost exact replica of a wing of my old house, on the
edge of a field, near Glastonbury.

Several months later, and I find myself with the responsibility of the
guardianship of this rather special valley on the north side of Chalice
Hill — 13 acres of pasture and hill land with mature trees, and at the
far end of the valley the remains of an orchard and a gothic barn in
need of TLC.

I set up camp on the land, and two things were immediately apparent.
That there was an abundant variety of wildlife here, in a beautiful
landscape that needed protection. And that many people — locals and
visitors — used and loved the place too, as they walked the footpath or
came for recreation or quiet, away from the bustle of the town. There’s
a 1912 photograph of the coombe, looking down from the footpath to the
woods that were then Dod Lane. There is the bench, and the citizens
relaxing on it. The cows graze in the distance. All is tranquil. Then as
now, it is a place to come for a bit of peace, to enjoy the views, to
meditate.

So the idea of making it a nature sanctuary, of preserving and enhancing
the landscape here, was not really a decision, but the obvious thing to
be done. If it is some work, I take that on willingly and with
enthusiasm. There’s much to do — new fencing, clearing, to repair the
farm buildings for stock in the spring. It is a time also for
assessment, to choose the right places and varieties for planting, for
sounding out local views and applying for the relevant permissions and
grants. Plans include a project to plant more broadleaved trees on the
northern edge, to replace dead trees on the top, as well as to replant
the old orchard next to the barn. Native shrubs (guelder rose, dogwood,
spindle) are also being considered, as well as a programme of
encouraging and planting a variety of wildflowers and grasses.

The sensitive restoration of the gothic barn is the other part of the
project. The building was purpose-built as a coachhouse and barn in
about 1840 with Flemish brickwork (a particular style of bricklaying)
and ashlar cut-stone surrounds in the *ferme ornée* style. It really is
a rare little gem of a Victorian gothic agricultural building. Inside,
it is more or less a shell, with rotted beams and floorboards; it is on
the English Heritage register of “buildings at risk”. It has planning
permission for conversion to a two-bedroom dwelling. These are now being
modified by Mark Orme, a local green architect. I hope that it will
eventually provide me with a comfortable home with almost no alteration
to its outside appearance.

An informal trust is being set up for the management of the valley, and
I hope very much that readers with an interest will contact me with
suggestions or historical information ([0774 371 8585](tel:+447743718585)). Willing hands for
the working parties planned for next year are very welcome too. Watch
this space for further details.

Bushy Coombe is now registered with Somerset Wildlife Trust as a
private nature reserve.

2014 update
-----------

A consortium of neighbours has bought most of the coombe, intending it
to continue as a beautiful area.
