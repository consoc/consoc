Around 45 members and friends turned up for the Glastonbury Conservation Society
annual general meeting, on October 19 at St Mary’s hall. For the fourth year in
a row, attendance was up: from 38 last year, 27 in 1996 and only 15 in 1995.

John Brunsdon, in the chair, signed the 1997 minutes (summarized in newsletter 86)
and said his latest yearly report had appeared in issue 89.
He thanked Jim Nagel for his work on publishing the newsletter and committee
members for their support during the year.

Ian Rands reported that he had attended a number of meetings,
including the Mendip District Council environment forum, concerned with
reducing waste of materials. Saving whales and tigers may not be the
Conservation Society’s role, but we can attempt to allay the effects of
industry, heating and vehicle pollution by planting trees. This we have
done most successfully: requests so far this winter total 4,000 trees.

Dennis Allen, treasurer, circulated copies of accounts for the year
ending last July, which the meeting adopted. Ena Allen reported that the
society has 148 paid-up members and an additional 45 people receive
newsletters.

There were no new nominations for officers. As the committee, except
Brian Dicketts, was willing to stand again for a third year, this was
proposed and carried unanimously.

Following some discussion concerning the remit of the society beyond a
five-mile radius from Glastonbury, Ian Rands suggested extending it to
10 miles. Jan Morland pointed out that this covers towns and villages,
which could cause difficulties, although most tree-planting takes place
in countryside.

It is important not to clash with other bodies, said Dennis Allen, and
any changes to our constitution must be approved by the Charity
Commissioners. Any proposal would also have to be on an agenda
circulated in advance of an AGM.

John Brunsdon said he would like to plant trees in the Newtown area of
Glastonbury — Archers Way was lined with trees until the former borough
council removed them about 1969 — and Jim Nagel said Norbins Road marks
its centenary this year: planting 100 trees in that area would be
appropriate. No firm decision was reached, but the committee will
consider representations for planting trees as far away as 10 miles from
the Market Cross.

Stephanie Morland offered to arrange a visit, in clement spring
weather, to look at the Morlands building designed by Jack Hepworth (see
photo in newsletter 89).

The formal meeting finished in just 25 minutes. Then Michael Mathias,
editor of the *Central Somerset Gazette* till retiring in June 1995,
showed his collection of slides of the Tor and the Levels taken over
many years—in quest of the perfect sunrise shot. See page 2.
