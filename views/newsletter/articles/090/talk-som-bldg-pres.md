Wells Civic Society members and other interested visitors joined us for
this most informative talk illustrated by slides. Russell Lillford,
architectural and historic group manager to Somerset county council, has
a long association with Glastonbury. He has achieved much for us and
would have done more if allowed to do so!

He first outlined the listed-building system, which seeks to protect
what is little more than one percent of our total building stock. Most
owners of listed buildings proudly take care of them, but legislation is
there to restrain those with inappropriate ideas of alteration.

Russell went on to describe the Somerset Building Preservation Trust’s
work of seeking to rescue worthy buildings that others will not or
cannot tackle. He outlined the problems the trust faces: the first
project, Tudor House at Langport, took 10 years to sell; Rook Lane
Chapel in Frome partly collapsed during work undertaken without
sufficient safeguards; opportunities were lost to purchase back more
reasonably the statue from the Temple of Harmony; the success of Robin
Hood’s Hut and the financial inability to tackle the concrete house at
Bridgwater.

Currently the trust is looking to restore Williton workhouse—a major
project. Meanwhile, near Stourhead, the Redlynch entrance built to
impress George III could be a useful training exercise in conservation
skills.
