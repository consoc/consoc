We actually started two days early, but this was only because, with
volunteers and the weather to take into account, one cannot work when
one chooses. Tree Week is one of those new European weeks of ten days
(from November 18 to December 6). We could work on only nine days.

However, with a lot of hard work by a dedicated band, we did plant our
thousand trees, and finished in time for a late lunch on the Sunday. We
call the site Kestrel Wood. It is owned by the Whites of Parbrook. On
most occasions when we were there, there was a kestrel hovering above us
for some of the time.

The turf was thick, but the soil a firm loam — not like some of last
winter’s sites. We got into a good swing and on some days managed to put
in 180 trees.

I must mention the diggers, without whom these projects would be
completely impossible: Derek Hankins, John Brunsdon, Iris Goodby, Mat
Golledge, Su Barnet, Christopher White, Adrian Pearse, Oliver Frost,
Janet Morland, Tom and Simon from Australia, Keith Matthews, Karen
Schlutter from Holland, Joe Keers, Alan Fear, Richard Raynsford, George
Steer senior, Mick Battye, Ian Rands.

We were not all there on every occasion, and we do need some more
diggers and providers. There must be more people who would like to join
us. Please come forward.
