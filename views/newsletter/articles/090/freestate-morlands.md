The Morland site is contaminated by centuries of tannery work, therefore
cleaning it up will cost so much that only large-scale big-business
commercial development makes economic sense — so goes the argument.

But, writes Bruce Garrard in the latest issue of *Free State* magazine,
“It could be seen the other way around: it is *because* the site is
intended for such large-scale commercial development that the cost will
be so high.”

The five-page article is the first of a series on the major social and
environmental issues involved. The magazine, from Unique Publications in
Glastonbury, sells for £1.95 through the tourist information centre and
local bookshops.

Redeveloping the old Morland factory site, a derelict eyesore on
Glastonbury’s doorstep for 16 years, is likely to be the subject of a
high-profile planning application in 1999. Ten years ago Mendip nearly
applied to compulsorily purchase the site from G.R. Holdings — this
anonymous London firm also owned the Fair Field and Wirral Park, the
green land that now is Safeway, housing and B&Q.
