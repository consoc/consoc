In response to the question “Was St. Patrick born in Somerset?” Harry Jelley
argued that his study of manuscript sources, placenames and archaeology provided
a positive answer.

Plentiful evidence exists to show that Romano-British society in Somerset
declined only gradually after the Roman withdrawal in 410. The records of
Palladius, sent to Britain in 431, indicate that there was also a Christian
community. Patrick, born in the early fifth century, states in his
autobiographical *Confessio* that his father had lived near BANNAVEM TABERNIAE.

Mr Jelley explained how this could be a corruption of BANNAVENTA BERNIAE. By
examining the component elements of this name and referring to placename
research he had reached the not-unreasonable conclusion that the location of
this site was at Banwell, where an area of Roman habitation had been discovered.

He also argued that an earthen bank in the form of a cross in woods near Banwell
represents a monument to Patrick’s birth — Glastonbury Abbey had claimed
Patrick’s burial by the 1150s. However, there was little evidence to support
this theory and the structure was probably a rabbit warren.

Although it will probably never be possible to prove either claim, Mr Jelley has
made an interesting foray into this most obscure of periods and those interested
can follow the arguments in detail in his book on the subject.
