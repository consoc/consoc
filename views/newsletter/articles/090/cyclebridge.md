The new bicycle bridge crossing the Hartlake River alongside the A39
Wells road is not new — “It has done a lot of miles,” said Alex Sully,
the cycling officer at county hall.

It was part of a bridge bought second-hand by the county council some
years ago to do temporary service at various construction sites, and WS
Atkins staff (most of them formerly with the Somerset highways
department) refurbished it for new two-wheel duty. It was swung into
place in mid-January.

The route between Glastonbury and Wells stems from planning for the
relief roads in the two towns — it was planned before Sustrans’
8,000-mile national cycle network, of which it is now part. Just past
the new bridge the route turns right and follows Long Drove to
Launcherley, avoiding A39 traffic
<span class="ednote">[and arrives in Wells near where
the Morrison supermarket now stands —Ed]</span>.

A set of nine sculptured stone seats to be placed along the
Glastonbury–Wells pilgrimage route as “sound waymarkers” was unveiled by
Bishop Jim Thompson in November. By artists Barry Cooper and Laurence
Parnell, each sculpture has a tuned bell that can be sounded by the
flick of a finger.

An opening ceremony will be held when works are complete in spring.
