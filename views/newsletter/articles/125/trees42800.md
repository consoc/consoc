The winter tree-planting season has just ended, and the Conservation
Society has now planted a grand total of 42,800 tree and hedge plants
since it was founded in 1971.

Volunteers started the winter at the Wells Road cemetery, generally
cleaning up an area over two weeks, in preparation for planting a holly
hedge.

Two Saturdays were spent at Bushy Coombe, constructing and erecting tree
cages (designed by Adrian Pearse), to protect previously planted trees
from damage by cows.

We then moved to Wootton Hill Farm, Butleigh Wootton, to plant a
roadside hedge of 660 plants for Mary Acland-Hood. In the final weeks we
worked at Draycott on land behind the Strawberry Fields farm shop. In
March we completed hedges in two fields, consisting of 3,215 plants. The
owner, Mike Pearce, has asked us to plant an orchard of 32 trees at the
same site.

Future work includes an orchard of 75 trees at Butleigh for Roland and
Marilyn Backhurst at (the curiously named) St James Square in the
village. A third were planted at the end of this season and the job will
finish at the start of next season.

Tor Leisure Centre has requested our help with planting hedges and
trees, and an enquiry has been made as to whether we would erect tree
cages at St Brideâ€™s mound, Beckery.
