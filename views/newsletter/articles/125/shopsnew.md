For most towns, the opening of two new witchcraft shops in the High
Street would be remarkable. But in Glastonbury, it’s news that among
nearly the dozen new shops to open in the High Street so far this year
are a piano showroom and a Boots.

Since neither grands nor uprights use walls, Piano Gallery also displays
local art.

**Piano Gallery**, showing 20 pianos ranging from £895 to £11,000, is an
offshoot of Pianoforte Ltd in Faringdon, near Swindon. The same people
owned Bristol Piano Company, but found many of its customers came from
deeper southwest so decided to relocate it to Glastonbury, in the former
Ayles furniture shop, a Georgian building. The directors, Steve and
Lesley Dash, had already moved to Benedict Street.

**Boots** last had a branch here in the 1960s. As a result of the merger
with Alliance chemists, it is now the only national chain store in
Glastonbury other than Woolworths.

A little way up is **Floral Touch**, owned by Katie Phillips of Compton
Dundon. The shop previously housed **Back to Back**, hairdressers who
moved to larger premises a few doors up.

Fruition commissioned Paul the cycling watercolourist. Here he is at
work, and his produce.

Across the road, **Fruition** has “fruit and vegetables as fresh, as
local and as organic as we can source them”. Even the wicker display
baskets are locally made. The proprietor is Tim Bates, who organizes
literary events for the Bruton Festival of Arts. He loves food and says
it’s important to reinvent oneself every few years: when Top of the
Crops came on the market, he took it as his next challenge.

Local organic food is also the theme of **La Lune**, the café opened by
Loretta Garner, from Street. Astrology is another theme: order your
chart with your mocha. She had the old Four Seasons second-hand leather
shop gutted and rebuilt, after the previous owner, Malcolm Slocombe, had
let it decay for decades. In the 1950s it was the Rose and Crown pub.

Two doors down, **Lilith** opened on May Day in the former Theo T. Ginn
traditional menswear shop. It’s now “designer clothing, art and
exclusive sculpture” on a goddess theme — “You have to go with the local
theme,” said the businesswoman owner, Maya Pinder. She is South African
by birth, and lives at Wick and Colorado. A few years ago she started
the Magick Box, almost next door, but became ill and sold it.

Oak-Apple Day, May 29, was **Cat and Cauldron**’s grand opening in the
former shoe shop in Market Place. It’s a “sister shop” to Witchcraft Ltd
(Pixie Tailor) in Benedict Street and the Magick Box, all run by Liz
Williams and Trevor Jones.

smallest shop a thorough makeover.

In Church Lane, alongside St John’s churchyard, is the new **Glastonbury
Pilgrim Reception Centre**, staffed by volunteers to help the many
visitors who come here not just as tourists. The coordinator is Morgana
West, and the telephone is [83 5572](tel:+441458835572).

And then, though not in the High Street, the former
Kwiksave-Somerfield-Kwiksave-Somerfield supermarket is now **Proper
Job**, a super-£1-type store (not just do-it-yourself items) that still
stocks milk for the convenience of mums collecting kids from nearby
schools. It’s number 4 in a chain of Proper Jobs, head office
Weston-super-Mare.
