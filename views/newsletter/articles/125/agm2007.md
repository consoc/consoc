Janet Morland has gamely taken on the jobs of both treasurer and
secretary of Glastonbury Conservation Society until someone steps
forward to volunteer for one of the roles.

Dennis Allen retired after 19 years as treasurer; he presented his final
accounts at the society’s annual general meeting on November 30. The
bank paid interest of only 90p on the society’s deposits in 2006–07. The
meeting was told action would be taken, and the account has now been
moved.

2007 was a productive year, said John Brunsdon in his chairman’s report.
“We’ve maintained the footpaths, been involved in a number of
parish-council schemes and our representations have been more
authoritative for consultation on planning applications.” But, he said,
“We are an ageing society and we need younger people, so we are always
on the lookout for fresh talent.”

Ian Rands and John were re-elected unopposed as vice-chairman and
chairman respectively.

Linda Hull was welcomed as a new committee member, and all others were
reappointed.

After the AGM business, John Coles gave an illustrated talk entitled “A
ride from Bath to Bournemouth on the main line of the Somerset and
Dorset Railway”, and Dick Green displayed some model trains.
