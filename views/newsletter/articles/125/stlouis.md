Former pupils and teachers of the St Louis Convent school in Magdalene
Street have a new location for the [*Remembering St Louis*
website](http://stlouisconvent.co.uk) they set up to record the
school’s history.

Working from memory, they have posted the layout of the convent, priory
and grounds back in the 1960s.

The converted Priory building has been converted to just two large
residential properties called Naish House at the front and Greenhill
House at the back; the builders have finished and for-sale boards are
up.

Next door, a separate developer turned the three-storey former classroom
building into two more large dwellings, named Magdalene House and Abbey
View. They have been on the market since early 2008 at around £400,000.

The St Louis nuns came from France in 1903, and lived at The Priory.
They eventually expanded to Somerset House next door (which was built as
the residence of the chief constable when Somerset Constabulary was
formed in Victorian times and originally had its headquarters in
Glastonbury).

The three-storey building was purpose-built in 1924 as a school, and the
new St Mary’s Church was built next to it in 1939–42. The convent school
thrived until 1984, when the nuns, declined in numbers and increased in
age, retired to their mother house at Minehead.

The playing field was sold to the Safeway supermarket chain (and St
Mary’s built a new church hall — where the Conservation Society and many
others meet). Millfield used the buildings as a pre-prep school until
moving to the Edgarley campus about five years ago, and another tract of
land was sold for the Cavendish Lodge retirement homes. Somerset House
has been the offices of a software firm for most of the time since the
sisters left.

The website has sections about the sisters’ other convents, St Mary’s
church and the Roman Catholic pilgrimages.

The priory house was built in the first quarter of the 19th century.
Sarah and Anna Greenhill Naish owned and lived in it; they also owned
the property where St Mary’s now stands. William Benjamin Naish was the
attorney who lived in the present High Street offices of Gould and
Swayne; he also owned the Abbey Kitchen, which Sarah and Anna Naish
used.
