It is the planting season again and there are plans for phase II of the
Willow Walk, along the cycle route west of Glastonbury. The travellers
have now gone, the end site has been cleared, and we are working with
the county council to develop the landscaping of this last section.

The intention is to build an earthwork, a series of ramps to take one a
few yards above ground level so that surrounding land patterns can be
viewed as well as the planting scheme along this corridor, and to give a
place to pause, to anticipate where one is going and where one has been.
The earthwork will take 18 months to put in place, so the planting and
seeding of this will be in 2000.

Volunteers turned out on March 7 to trim, prune, cut and reweave the
willow planted last year, and again on the following Sunday to replant
about 40 poles which had not taken, to continue planting the long avenue
to the maze area, to plant truncheons around all the circles in order to
give them greater substance while the cuttings become more established,
and to plant the Spiral.
