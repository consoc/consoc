[Sustrans](https://sustrans.org.uk/) is "the charity making it easier
for people to walk and cycle" — that’s the slogan on its website. Among
other things, it is the custodian of the National Cycle Network.

Founded in 1977 as Cyclebag, Sustrans is supported by more than 3,500
volunteers around the whole of Britain. Head office is in Bristol.

On a drizzly day in February, Sustrans opened a key connection in the
national cycle route that avoids the busy A39 toward Bridgwater, and it
was immediately swarming with users. Villagers in Bawdrip now have a
safe link to their school and shop in Cossington. “People who used to
put their kids in the car just to cross the road can now go without
getting the car out,” said Ben Hamilton-Baillie, Sustrans’ regional
manager for Wales and the Southwest, based in Bristol. “People in
Cossington met neighbours from Bawdrip they had never seen before.”

The route uses the old railway line, overgrown and long forgotten,
passing underneath the A39. Negotiations involved six landowners at
costs of tens of thousands. The 1½-mile path is still to be properly
surfaced.

Glastonbury and all the Polden villages—Ashcott, Shapwick, Catcott,
Edington, Chilton Polden. Cossington, Bawdrip, Chedzoy—now have a safe
link through to Bridgwater without touching the dangerous A39 with its
fast traffic along the hogsback section.

Towards Wells, the Siren sculptures are proving popular for family
outings with children, who excitedly pedal on to the next sculpture
where they can ring its bell. A friendlier cycle link into Wells city
centre is planned.
