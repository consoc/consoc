If your bicycle is languishing in the garage you could do worse than to
wheel it out and try the recreational ride on page 4
<span class="ednote">[see box below]</span>.
Experience the “joys and wonders of nature” — as a
girl of 11 wrote in the book in the bird hide at Meare Heath Restoration
Project.

The route takes National Cycle Route 3 out of Glastonbury via the new
[Willow Walk](/newsletter/articles/091/willow-walk).
Then it follows the old railway line to
the English Nature hide overlooking Meare Heath, where worked-out peat
diggings are now lakes again.

You can go on further to the iron-age huts at Willows Peat Centre and
beyond — but we won’t hold it against you if you don’t go that far on
your first two-wheeled outing.

It’s also a useful route between Glastonbury and Meare, avoiding
trafficked roads. It is a must for anybody interested in birds.

Serious birders get there at dawn, but we cycled the route, slowly, on
the afternoon of April 15 and found an array of Britain’s wildlife at
sunset. We heard lapwing (sounding like R2D2 on wings) and Canada geese
before we saw them. A pair of marsh harriers flew past right in front of
us. Less common birds include egrets and hobbies.

A kingfisher sometimes perches on the bridge leading to the hide. Swifts
and martens are beginning to arrive back home for summer. Look out for
otter and roe deer. English Nature recently excavated around the hide to
make a habitat that we hope will attract Britain’s rarest breeding bird,
the bittern.

The journey is about 4½ miles one way, and the only hill is Glastonbury
island as you near home.

### The route

Take Benedict Street out of Glastonbury, cross the relief road at the
lights and follow the blue signs for National Cycle Route 3. It takes
you through the timber yard, then first right, then first left through
the Willow Walk, over the Brue bridge with its Millennium Milepost and
almost straight ahead towards Sharpham.

Where the road bears left at the phonebox, cycle straight ahead along
the old rail route — worked-out peat diggings on both sides of the road
are now flooded year-round as nature-conservation areas.

Passing the Railway Inn pub at Ashcott Corner, carry on straight ahead
into the nature reserve. Turn left along a track to a viewing area
behind screens, or cycle to the right over a little bridge and up a
grassy track to the hide, where you can sit comfortably for hours.

Return by the same route and stop at the pub for a drink or food with
landlord Maggie and Mike Bendle (86 0223). If it isn’t open, knock:
“I’ll never see a weary traveller dying on his last legs” were his very
words. Most of his trade these days arrives on two wheels; 110 years ago
steam carried them on 100 wheels.
