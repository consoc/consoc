Dear Mr Brunsdon,

Having joined the Conservation Society at the beginning of the year, I
have greatly appreciated the events and newsletter as a way of helping
me to get to know Glastonbury better.

I noticed in newsletter 100 (August) that, “wearing a Mendip Councillor
hat, [you] pleaded strongly at a recent meeting for more urgent
attention to problems on Coursing Batch, Chilkwell Street, Bere Lane,
Fishers Hill and Street Road, where both residents and visitors are at
risk from heavy A361 traffic thundering through the Conservation Area
past tourist attractions.”

As you can see from my address, I also have a personal interest in this
issue. I remain concerned about the impact of traffic, particularly
heavy goods vehicles, on the fabric of the buildings in the Conservation
Area and on the perception of tourists visiting sites in the district.

Is the Conservation Society able to address these issues further as part
of its programme and policy? Perhaps I am unaware of work already being
done here or in other respects, or what can be done to more effectively
protect the Conservation Area from the incursions of heavy traffic. Is
there anything to add on the subject?
