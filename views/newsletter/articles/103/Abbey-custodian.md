David Morgan talked to a large and appreciative audience on March 15
about “my time at the Abbey”. He came to Glastonbury following a
successful career with the Gurkhas to spend a very different seven years
both in the Abbey and promoting wider tourism in the town. He recounted
a number of amusing incidents involving visitors.

Much has in fact happened during his custodianship. A new duckpond has
been dug and stocked with large fish from the old pond, which has been
dredged and restocked with a greater variety of fish. Repairs have been
ongoing to the ruins, and part of the Abbey wall along Bere Lane had an
expensive rebuild following badger damage.

The grounds have been used for several performances of a summer
Classical Extravaganza, which has been much enjoyed. Recently an
underground power cable has been laid, which will enable more
unobtrusive use of electricity.

Altogether it has been a very successful time, and we thank David
sincerely for his contribution to Glastonbury and wish him well.
