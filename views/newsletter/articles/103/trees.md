This winter we accepted the challenge of planting more than a thousand
trees and shrubs out at Barton St David on the land by the house of Bob
Burns (Burns the Bread), who is a member of our society.

There are three groups of trees, each in the corners farthest from the
house:

- *nut copse*, with beech, sweet chestnut, hazel, spindle, crab apple,
  common pear, red and yellow dogwood, purging buckthorn and wild cherry
- *shrub forest*, with ash, oak, spindle, holly, wayfaring tree, field
  maple, hornbeam, whitebeam, wild cherry, purging buckthorn
- *swampy wood*, with downy birch, black and white poplar, alder
  buckthorn, white and scarlet willow, Italian and red alder, osier and
  aspen.

The job includes two hedges:

- *beech hedge* of 500 shrubs stretching for 100 yards
- *mixed countryside hedge*, with 300 hawthorn and 10 or 20 of each of
  field maple, red and yellow dogwood, hazel, spindle, beech, ash, wild
  privet and wild cherry, oak, snowy mespil, dog rose, wayfaring tree and
  golden rose — making a total of 500 shrubs in 100 yards.

Next winter we will fill in any gaps with honeysuckle and snowberry.
Already the spindle leaves and berries are showing.

Winter tree-planting report
---------------------------

We turned out twelve times, usually in good weather, and worked at five
different sites: Dunstan’s Dyke, Watchwell Drove, along the River Brue
by Cow Bridge, East Pennard and Barton St David. Twenty-three persons
put in a combined total of 79 appearances, making about 240
person-hours.

To turn out so conscientiously deserves one’s name in lights. So may I
offer a heartfelt thanks to all these good folk: five members of the
Carmen family, two Fears, Adrian Pearse with Caroline from the USA,
father and son Bell, Lud and Cathy van den Bosch, our chairman and
secretary and treasurer, Andrew Bond, Keith Matthews, John Morland, Joe
Keers, Richard Raynsford, Joe Joseph, Bob Burns, Martin Webb, Ave
Reiter, Caharlie Parsons from the newly formed Street Society, and your
correspondent.

We put in 1,710 trees and shrubs, bringing the grand total since
Glastonbury Conservation Society was founded to 29,002.

Black poplars (continued)
-------------------------

You will remember, no doubt, [the article in the last newsletter about
the saving of black poplars at Clyce Hole](/newsletter/articles/102/poplars/). The Advanced Training Unit
removed the old metal guards, after which John Brunsdon pruned the
trees. On a windy day Keith Matthews and I went to the site and salvaged
40 quite good pitchers — not for maidens to gather water but for us to
propagate the trees. For those who don’t know about these matters, and I
was one when I first came to Somerset, it is possible to make a tree
grow from a part of a branch stuck in the ground — especially the wet
trees like willow and poplar and to some extent alder.

Anyway, back to the pitchers, which in western Somerset are sometimes
called truncheons. Cut lengths of four or five feet from branches about
the thickness of your thumb and sharpen the lower ends in the shape of a
screwdriver. Make a hole in the ground to one third of the length of the
pitcher, push down the pitcher and stamp it in snug. It will grow.

To protect an orchard from the north wind
-----------------------------------------

A couple of years ago we planted up an orchard at East Pennard for
Alardus and Cathy (Turnbull) van den Bosch, stalwart members of
Glastonbury Conservation Society and faithful planters of trees for
other people when our gang goes out.

This winter we planted 70 yards of hedge to protect the apple trees.

Now if you want to come by a hedge, the best way is to ask your friends
if they can help. And they did:

- Neil Bannell of West Bradley, hawthorn, oak, ash, field maple  250
- Mr and Mrs Todd of Beechbarrow, some more beech  81
- John Morland and Martin Webb, withy pitchers from Cow Bridge  30
- Myself, oak and ash in pots  8
- Bob Burns, beech  7
- Jim Nagel, field maple in a pot  1
- Then buy from Chew Valley Trees ten of each of ten chosen species  100

Add some friendly folk with spades and you have a very good hedge. Thank
you, donors.

Many members and other readers of our newsletter will remember Gerry
Andrews, who used to work in the countryside department at County Hall.
He advised and helped us at the times of our work on the Wearyall Hill
project and its extension, and most of all on the cedar avenue at
Butleigh when we won those competitions organized by the Civic Trust. In
a Christmas card he wrote:
