Sadly, it seems, all good things come to an end. David Morgan, OBE, is
leaving his post as Abbey custodian. His tenure has been a period of
progress and excellent relationship with the town. He has served on the
executive committee of the Chamber of Trade as well.

Likewise, Ted Aggar retires as town clerk. He came to us as a Freeman of
the City of London and retired senior police inspector, and we have been
served with integrity and excellent advice. It speaks oceans that his
assistant, Jane Czerni, trained by him, is the choice to take over.

Frank Dunster, our loyal and highly regarded cemetery groundsman, also
retires. Letters of commendation have regularly appeared in the local
papers and the Burial Board has awarded him a tankard in recognition.
His will be a hard act to follow.

All three schools in the town now have new head teachers, and St John’s
Church gets a new vicar on July 31, the first woman in the post. We look
forward to a new era of fresh ideas and experience.

Sadly, we are left with some of the longstanding problems, the foremost
being heavy A361 traffic continuing to be routed along Coursing Batch
and Chilkwell Street. Along with others I represent strongly on your
behalf. I understand new measures may include further speed restrictions
and a speed camera.

Closed-circuit television cameras are imminent for the High Street and
carparks, and new control measures on road traffic near the Tor
likewise. None of these measures will work perfectly without adequate
police presence — especially with the resumption of the pop festival.

Gift Aid declaration

Members who pay income tax are asked to fill in the [Gift Aid
form](/dl/membership.pdf) and return it to the treasurer if they have not
already done so. This is a painless and worthwhile way of increasing our
income: the Inland Revenue will hand over to the society the tax you
have already paid on the amount of your subscription.
