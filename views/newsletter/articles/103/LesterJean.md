Members of the society will be saddened to hear that Jean Lester died,
aged 63 years, on February 4 after a long battle with bone cancer.

She was born in Croydon and during childhood went to Australia, where
she eventually trained as a nurse before returning to England. After
several nursing jobs she chose midwifery, which gave her much joy and
satisfaction.

Eventually she settled with children Gillian and Richard in Frome, and
it was of course through her interest in wildlife that she met David
Lester, the Somerset Wildlife Trust honorary warden of Great Breach Wood
and at that time chairman of the trust’s Wells area. They started
married life in the Wells Road, then moved to the Actis estate. During
this time David was a member of the Conservation Society committee. They
moved to a cottage in Barton St David about ten years ago.

Jean was a very keen gardener, and, with both David and Jean’s interest
in wild plants, you will not be suprprised to hear that their garden in
Barton gradually propagated common spotted orchids in the wild section.
She was a member of the Green Gardening Club.

She enjoyed sewing and tapestry. She helped with the new hassocks
recording the millennium for the local church. She delivered meals on
wheels.

Her life was very active and over the last few years she fought her
illness to remain as involved as possible. As late as 12 months ago she
flew with David to visit the USA again. In her last autumn her first
grandchild was born. By this year David and Jean had enjoyed 20 years of
marriage.
