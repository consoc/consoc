We learn that Roy and Avril Coles have already sold Middle Wick Farm,
where they established a prestigious residential holiday complex.

We as a society supported them in their initial concept to convert the
barn, farmhouse and outbuildings into holiday units in a glorious
setting with views to the Mendips and Wells. Working hard they attracted
many overseas visitors who came back regularly to holiday in
Glastonbury.

Roy and Avril now live at Rowley Road â€” still with the view!
