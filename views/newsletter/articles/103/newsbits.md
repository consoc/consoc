Alan Gloak chaired the first meeting of Glastonbury’s new Recycling
Action Group (RAG) on February 25 in the Town Hall. Those attending were
keen for Glastonbury to be a pilot project for a kerbside collection
scheme.

(Jim Nagel’s home town in Canada — Kitchener, Ontario — has done this
for nearly 30 years.)

Somerset and Mendip have less than two years to meet government targets
of recycling a far higher proportion of waste than now.

Disposable plates made of potato starch were shown to the RAG meeting.
The maker, a startup firm in South Somerset, hopes to introduce them at
this summer’s pop festival at Pilton. They look exactly like polystyrene
but can be eaten by birds or fish.

Romulus and Remus
-----------------

Following our collection of beech seedlings (newsletter 102), the need
to repair the landmark cement statue of Romulus and Remus above Wells on
the Bristol road has been identified. A plan is being made to involve
principally the Italian community in this project. All interested should
contact Ian Rands (85 0509). We now need to raise funds for a worthwhile
Jubilee project.

New use for old library
-----------------------

The old library building in Northload Street has been leased to Turning
Point, a drug-rehabilitation scheme. Builders and painters are at work
installing partitions.

Blooming work begins
--------------------

Glastonbury in Bloom starts work at the end of May with high hopes of
regaining the trophy this year of the Golden Jubilee.
