To the right of the doorway are some thin arched windows with many diamond-shaped glass panes. The doorway leads to a hallway, and another arched doorway leading to outdoors is visible at the far end.">

A cold wait on the pavement on March 17 was eventually rewarded by a
most interesting visit to our internationally famous Lake Village
exhibiton. Nancy Hollinrake introduced this splendid collection, owned
by the Antiquarian Society and maintained by the county museum service.

Afterwards we examined the fascinating mediaeval merchant’s house that
now serves also as the tourist information centre.

Glastonbury Tribunal Ltd is chaired by Dennis Allen, our treasurer.

-------------------

Many of the Antiquarian Society’s events this season are field visits
rather than evening lectures. At its AGM in December, Wells Cathedral
librarian Jean Moore gave an illustrated talk about the cathedral
library and invited the Antiquarians to visit it on May 25 between 9:15
and noon. The tour includes the high parts above the aisles and up the
towers — not recommended for those with asthma or heart conditions.

It will require four guides in addition to Jean Moore, so the cathedral
asks for donations, suggesting £4.50 (or £3 for seniors). Numbers are
limited to two groups of 10. Please register with Desmond Miller at 83
3660.

### Golden secretary

John Loveridge was thanked at the Antiquarian
Society’s AGM for his 50 years as its secretary. Desmond Miller, who had
been treasurer, filled the gap.
