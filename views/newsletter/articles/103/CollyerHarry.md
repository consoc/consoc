We have lost a well-known character who was the local representative for
the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. He also served on
the Antiquarian Society committee but never joined our society. He was a
test driver for Fiats and drove them up to his death.

An undoubted eccentric, Harry Collyer championed many local causes —
some more deserving than others, but making us all think a bit harder in
consequence. He took great care in the restoration of Barnside, his
listed residence at 2 Chilkwell Street, between the Abbey Barn and the
Rifleman’s Arms pub. He claimed it was used as a hostel by masons
working on the mediaeval Abbey.

Our thoughts are with his wife, Daphne, the daughter of the Abbey
custodian during the war.
