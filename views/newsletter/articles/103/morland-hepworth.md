The eyesore ruins of the old Morland and Baily tanneries are at last to
be pulled down. A half-dozen buildings could be worth re-using; the rest
of the 45 acres will be dismantled and materials reclaimed where
possible.

However, visitors are unlikely to see any visible change at the
disgraceful southern gate to Glastonbury before September.

The few buildings that could find a new life are the red brick houses
along Beckery Old Road, the listed Mill Cottage at the Street end of the
site, the Hepworth building, the Baily’s stone buildings and chimney,
the caretaker’s cottage, the Bauer building and the red brick buildings
at the south end of the site. They will be examined in detail and then
demolition will start across the rest of the site.

“Morlands will be a sustainable development and this begins with
clearing the site,” said Colin Molton, the development director at the
Southwest RDA (Regional Development Agency). “Before demolition we will
first salvage all materials suitable for future use, as we have done
with other sites owned by the agency.” He said the RDA is “committed to
sustainability principles promoted by the government in the Urban White
Paper and also by the agency in our own Regional Strategy.”

This next stage of work was announced in March after a meeting of the
Morlands Partnership Advisory Group. Among its members are Alan Gloak,
John Brunsdon, Evelyn Rideout and Mary Parker from Glastonbury.

Mendip council has owned 9 acres nearest the town since 1995, and last
spring the RDA bought the main 31 acres from a private developer in
London. The last tannery closed 20 years ago.

An unsafe wall was taken down in late March — part of one of the Baily’s
buildings fronting Beckery Old Road which will not be demolished. The
removed stone has been stored on site for future use.

Early public consultation around the site is continuing. Anyone
