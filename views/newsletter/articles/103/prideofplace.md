The title is written upwards vertically in the right section, in white text. Below this is a small grey square reading in black text, “The David Knightly Charitable Trust”. In the left section are some photographs: one of people with yellow hats sitting, one of an illistration of a river and tree, one of some people standing underneath a shelter structure, and one showing some houses at the far side of a lake.">

Our society’s 1984 project features in a special colour brochure marking
21 years of Pride of Place awards from the David Knightly Charitable
Trust. Photos by Jan Morland appear on the cover and inside.

A paragraph reads:

> Glastonbury Civic Society <span class="ednote">[which should read Glastonbury
> Conservation Society, although we are affiliated to the national Civic
> Society]</span> decided to rescue one of the platform canopies
> from the old station disused since the 1960s. It was dismantled and
> re-erected in the public carpark behind the fine mediaeval church in
> the town centre where the Tuesday market is held. The society rightly
> foresaw that the canopy would provide welcome shelter, particularly on
> wet days. And so it does!

In the foreword, Sir Neil Cossons, chairman of English Heritage, writes
to commend the work of the David Knightly Charitable Trust:

> For 21 years the trust has been a pioneer in promoting community
> involvement in the historic environment and in recognizing the
> importance of creating attractive, well designed places for people to
> live in.
>
> We know that most people place a high value on the historic
> environment. A recent MORI poll established that 76 percent of the
> population believe that it enriches their lives, that 88 percent think
> it is important in creating jobs and boosting the economy and that an
> overwhelming 98 percent believe that schoolchildren should have the
> opportunity to study it. The trust’s Pride of Place Awards have tapped
> this enthusiasm. They have encouraged people to work together to make
> their environment more attractive, more accessible and more
> interesting. Properly presented, the historic environment is the most
> immediate of historical documents, capable of giving a depth and
> dimension to life from which no one need be excluded.
>
> Perhaps the Trust’s most important contribution has been to show the
> way for others to follow. The Pride of Place Awards have had an effect
> far wider than the individual schemes themselves. They have helped to
> develop a whole new attitude to community involvement in environmental
> improvement. It is an approach whose time has come.
>
> The Trust deserves our thanks and congratulations for its work over
> the last 21 years, and our best wishes for the future.
