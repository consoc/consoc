The Priory, the Georgian house at the right of the photo, once part of
the St Louis convent and school and then of Millfield’s Abbey School, is
to be grand again, as two dwellings of 3,500 sq ft. The drawing room of
the rear unit is the original 20ft × 30ft salon with 20ft ceilings and
windows.

The developer, Malcolm Lambert of Wells, is keen to restore the windows
and asks the society if archive photos or plans might still exist.

The taller building at left, purpose-built by the convent as a school in
1926, is also becoming two large dwellings, on the scale of its
neighbour. Richard Middleton is the developer here. Both projects hope
to finish by year end; neither is connected with the new-build Cavendish
retirement homes at the rear of the properties.
