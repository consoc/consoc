Damaging tree guards have been removed from black poplars at Clyce Hole
weir, on the river Brue halfway between Pomparles Bridge and Cow Bridge.
The guards were necessary to protect the trees from cattle but were not
checked to allow for growth. The work, by the Advanced Training Unit,
took two days and enabled further pruning; trees should now recover
well.

Our society made a bid to the EU’s SW Region budget to fund this
project.

Black poplars (*Populus nigra*) are Britain’s “rarest and most splendid
native timber tree.” Only 2,000 to 3,000 remain, many near the end of
their lifespan; in 1993 environmental scientists predicted the species
would be extinct in 20 years. Reaching 100 feet in height, it was once
as common as oak, a distinctive feature of lowland river valleys. But
now the scattered remaining trees do not seem to be regenerating from
seed. So much suitable habitat has been drained since the 19th century
(roots require dampness all year). Other threats are hybridization with
non-native poplars and indiscriminate felling of “unsafe” trees.

This is a fast-growing deciduous tree with broad green leaves a bit like
ivy. Flowers appear in spring before leaves: small yellowish-green
flowers in catkins; predominant colour is their red stamens.

Traditionally, black-poplar wood, slow to burn, is used for matchsticks,
Dutch clogs and Camembert cheese boxes. Folklore said the water dripping
from hollows “takes away warts, wheals and breakings-out of the body”.
Modern herbalists use ointment from its flower buds to treat
haemorrhoids, arthritis and bronchitis.

The *Telegraph* invited readers to help list all black poplars. This and
other efforts to save it: <span class="ednote">2018 update: link no longer
