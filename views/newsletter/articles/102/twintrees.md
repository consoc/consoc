About thirty years ago I came across an unusual sight in a forest in the
Taurus mountains east of the Rhine. Several times between then and now I
have returned to keep an eye on its progress. Last September I took my
camera so that you might be able to share this phenomenon with me.

On the corner of a large plantation of ash and oak and beech, and by the
side of a well-worn track, I spotted a damaged young ash sapling. It had
been slit through from north to south, and also from east to west, and
then bound up for the wounds to heal and for the tree to carry on
living.

Now who had done this, and why? I had heard that children of families
who lived and worked in the woods were, when small babies, passed
through a split tree as part of their initiation rites, and that the
practice was not uncommon. If you read Thomas Hardyâ€™s *The Woodlanders*
and enter a large forest, you will understand.

Was my tree, with its double split, used to initiate twins? The tree
survived, as you will see by the photographs. Did it bring good
luck to the twins? When they die, will the tree die also?
