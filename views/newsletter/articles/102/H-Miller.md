Cecil Hamilton-Miller will be remembered as a quiet-spoken gentleman who
practised as a solicitor in the old firm of Austin and Bath in Chilkwell
Street. He was first elected to the old Glastonbury borough council in
1958; asÂ mayor in 1969 he wore his full robes to climb the Tor for a
meeting of the Druids.

On the committee of our society, he gave invaluable advice during early
difficult times. He lived at Parkside, Bere Lane, later retiring to West
Pennard and then to live near his daughter Juliet Smith near Norwich. He
died at age 91 in early December, and his ashes are to be scattered in
Glastonbury.

Many, like your chairman, have had cause to be grateful for his
professional help. His pleasant face continues to look down from his
portrait at meetings of the town council.
