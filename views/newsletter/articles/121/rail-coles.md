Summary of a talk by John Coles

</aside>

John Coles provided a capacity audience after the society’s AGM on
December 1 with an evocative glimpse of the final years of the Somerset
and Dorset railway in moving pictures. An additional bonus was coverage
of the fate of some of its few surviving features in the four decades
since closure in March 1966.

Optimism still prevailed in the film showing the centenary celebrations
of the opening of the Somerset Central Railway from Glastonbury to
Highbridge held on 28 August 1954, when a special train with guests in
costume traversed the route viewed by a multitude of spectators and
recorded for a celebratory brochure.

However, the situation had deteriorated considerably by the time the BBC
filmed John Betjeman’s journey from Evercreech to Burnham in 1963. Many
stations were semi-derelict and overgrown, the rollingstock rusting and
shabby, and passengers few. The sense of decay was highlighted as
Betjeman sought out the monuments from better days: the extensive
deserted locomotive works, silted-up wharf, and even the bronze war
memorial and ornamental cast-iron benches at Highbridge.

Neglect was apparent in all departments for at least six years before
the line closed — freight had been transferred to road as distribution
needs changed (Clarks shoes were a particular example, in contrast to
the founding Clarks as keen backers of building the railway); there was
no feeling of a future in the railways and staff morale had collapsed.
The slow death of the line was even exacerbated by the reluctance of
civil servants to give the closure order.

Finally, film of constructing the Glastonbury relief road in 1993 showed
some of the remaining sections of trackbed near the town being removed
and replaced by tarmac. While the occasional relic from this now-remote
era has been preserved, its disappearance is now as complete as the
majestic elms the films showed once bordering its course.

Dick Green brought along a “rake” of five passenger coaches with a
locomotive he made to match, all done up in the old Somerset & Dorset
livery of 1870: dark Prussian blue with gold lettering. He bought the
coaches, badly damaged, from an executor’s stand at a Gauge O Guild show
in Telford in September and refurbished them. Dick’s other models were
mainly of the Great Western Railway.
