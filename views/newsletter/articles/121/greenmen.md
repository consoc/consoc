Summary of a talk by Richard Raynsford

</aside>

Richard Raynsford recently attended a course at Sheffield University
where Dr David Borthwick contended that representations of the “green
man” were *not* fertility symbols related to local customs and developed
from the “wild man of the woods”, evolving from pre-Christian pagan
beliefs — contrary to general opinion, which stems largely from the
opinions of Lady Raglan in the late 19th century.

At our meeting on October 20, Richard presented a considerable arsenal
of slides from his peregrinations the length and breadth of the country
to illustrate that there was a clear pattern of development in the
representation of green men as essentially related to Christian
symbolism.

At Pilton church, this carving on the spandrels of the 15th-century roof
is a green man with a protruding tongue and foliage emerging from his
mouth. (Photo by Richard Raynsford, on the [Pilton

Green men are not seen in Saxon carvings, even though heads can be
portrayed among foliage, as at Codford St Peter. They begin in Norman
churches as “beak heads”, thought to represent evil spirits — Lincoln
Cathedral possesses numerous examples. Beak heads, often also possessing
horns, evolved to the familiar form of green men, with branches and
leaves emerging from the mouth and occasionally ears or eyes; they are
considered to represent a head speaking evil, the leaves representing
the evil, and their purpose being as an admonition not to do evil.
Examples with protruding tongues are thought to portray stupidity.

Consequently, most green men are to be found inside churches, where
similar forms are sometimes seen being crushed below fonts — baptism
being a way of negating evil spirits. They are normally carved in stone
or wood (Devon is a county with particularly numerous and fine examples)
and do not seem to appear in glass or in painted form.

Their significance became more obscure in the post-Reformation era, and
green men appear as a purely decorative feature even in non-religious
contexts, as seen for example in the carving on the facade of Lloyds
bank in the High Street.
