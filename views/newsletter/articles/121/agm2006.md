Attendance was excellent at the 2006 annual general meeting of
Glastonbury Conservation Society, on December 1 at St Mary’s church hall
— numbers were bolstered by railway enthusiasts of all ages who came to
see films of our old [Somerset & Dorset Railway](/newsletter/articles/121/rail-coles/) by John
Coles shown after the meeting.

The chairman gave his [report of the year](/newsletter/articles/121/chairnotes-rands/) and
then read notes from Ian Rands, who was unable to attend.

Officers and committee were re-elected to continue to serve. (During
2006, Roger Forsey was co-opted onto the committee. Anthony Ward
resigned in November.)

In the “income” column it describes opening balances totalling £8218.84, most of which is in a building society. It shows income from subscriptions, donations, trees, a footpath grant, bank interest, and a bank refund, totalling £7861.91, most of which is from trees. In the “expenditure” column are rows for Civic Trust, hall hire, secretary expenses, Terry Carmen expenses, newsletters, postage, trees, strimmer, and tax, totalling £7347.75, the majority of which was on trees. The closing balances total £8733.00, most of which is in the building society. The two columns balance.">

The treasurer’s report was agreed.

A donation of nearly £300 has been received to be used specifically for
tree and hedge projects on the Tor. Many thanks for this generosity! The
National Trust’s current stewardship scheme comes up for renewal in
2008, when new projects will be included. We shall propose a
reinstatement of old hedgelines in “Carters Field” off Basketfield Lane
to recreate the mediaeval field pattern currently marked by old banks
and ditches.

And under “any other business”:

- Making a photographic record of the town — like the one done in the
  1950s — was suggested as a project. Anyone with a camera to help should
  please contact the chairman.

- The People’s Trust for Endangered Species is conducting a national
  survey of old orchards to find a rare native beetle, the noble chafer
  (*Gnorimus nobilis*). Ian and Carol Tucker have made their orchards
  available if our society would like to get involved. Volunteers should
  please contact the chairman.
