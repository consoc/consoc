The administrator of Wells Cathedral, John Roberts, gave a most
competent illustrated talk to a rather depleted Antiquarian Society
gathering at the library on December 8. Road closures for the Frost Fair
probably did not help.

He stressed that the development was not just about providing a new
restaurant in the Mary Mitchell garden (albeit on the footprint of an
old building). It was about much more: the provision of choristersâ€™
rooms, a meeting room and new toilets for a start.

Furthermore, areas of the cathedral at present never seen by the public
will be open to all, and the cloisters will again be a complete
unobstructed walkway. To enable this to happen, a blocked doorway will
reopen and unworthy modern buildings will be removed.

Much money has to be raised for this project. Unlike other countries
where the state owns and funds cathedrals, our cathedrals have to fund
themselves. Recent surveys show how our cathedrals are attracting
increasing numbers for both worship and admiration.
