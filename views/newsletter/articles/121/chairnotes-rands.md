Ian Rands asked to be invested as MBE locally rather than at the Palace
in order that all the Conservation Society tree-planters could share in
it. So at the Town Hall on October 13 the red ribbon was pinned beside
his tie by Somerset’s Lord Lieutenant, Lady Gass (seated at left of
photo).

A major event of 2006 was the award of the MBE to Ian Rands for services
to conservation in Somerset, as vice-chair of Glastonbury Conservation
Society. This recognition of his outstanding work in tree-planting
locally is justly deserved, especially as he has to hand on the
organizing of trees to Alan Fear after health warnings.

Betrothal Couple repaired, damaged again
----------------------------------------

The mayor, John Coles, and I received a commendation from the Somerset
Building Preservation Trust in the Stansell awards, held at Hestercombe
House, for the repair of 15th-century corbels at 2 Market Place and of
the town’s 19th-century market cross. The citation reads: “A careful and
sensitive repair of important features which collectively enhance the
town-centre conservation area.” Unfortunately, there has been
subsequent damage to the Betrothal Couple corbel, which will be repaired
again.

Footpath scheme
---------------

We continue to operate the Parish Scheme for county footpath clearance
on behalf of the town council. Nathan Pritchard has taken on this
management, but needs more help. We now own a motorized strimmer. The
hardsurfacing on the path up Bushy Coombe by Mendip council, by
permission of Rory Weightman, the landowner, has been a big improvement.
Our guidebook, *Glastonbury Footpath Walks*, has sold well as usual.

Newsletter
----------

The newsletter has been distributed to members and has received
favourable comments. Thanks to Jim Nagel for his competent editing, and
to contributors, especially Adrian Pearse, who regularly takes notes at
meetings. Also to Ena Allen, who has for many years organized the
distribution and subscription reminders, in liaison with her treasurer
husband, Dennis. We need to relieve Ena of this task, with many thanks
to both.

Committee
---------

Our secretary, Janet Morland, has convened regular committee meetings
and taken minutes. Last year’s AGM strengthened the committee with new
and younger members, and we look to repeat this. Thanks to all who have
served during the year.

A committee member with architectural and planning experience would be
especially useful, since one of the society’s roles is to comment on
planning issues to the local authority. The Local Development Framework,
replacing the local Mendip-wide plan, is in the process of formulation;
it covers proposals for the next 20 years. The committee has discussed
the Preferred Options Report.

We have encouraged the county council to progress a bid for World
Heritage status. A public meeting in October indicated the county’s
preference for a bid based on the Somerset Levels but embracing both
Glastonbury and Wells. Discussions will be protracted.

We have held our usual winter lectures, which have been quite well
attended at St Mary’s church hall, and also with the Antiquarian Society
at the library. Inevitably there are clashes with other events on the
same evenings. Suggestions for future meetings are welcome (and we are
looking for a volunteer to co-ordinate speakers).

As vice-chair of Mendip District Council I hosted a meeting at Frome
covering 20 years of grant-funding of historic buildings in Frome. I was
able to draw some comparisons with our town.

It has been an interesting year, with a steady membership. More could be
achieved with your help.

3,700 trees planted in one year
-------------------------------

**Ian Rands adds** that last year was the best ever for tree-planting —
more than 3,700, of which 1,000-plus were sizeable saplings — and
brought the best turnout of helpers. [Newsletter
119 (June) has more details](/newsletter/articles/119/trees-bloom/). So far this winter
we have concentrated on maintenance of trees at Bushy Coombe, at the
south side of Bretenoux Road, at the settlement pond alongside the
relief road, and at the carnival sheds at Common Moor Drove.

Contact Alan Fear ([83 3185](tel:+441458833185)) if you’d like to help. Hedge-planting and
other activities are planned for 2007.
