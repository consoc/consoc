Summary of a talk by Tim Hopkinson-Ball to the Antiquarian Society

</aside>

Generally viewed in haste from the A39 halfway to Bridgwater, Chilton
Priory is normally dismissed as a minor Victorian folly — but closer
inspection reveals an interesting history. It was the subject of a talk
on November 10 after the Antiquarian Society’s AGM by Tim
Hopkinson-Ball.

Chilton Priory was the creation of eccentric William Stradling,
1788–1859, an antiquary, freemason and deputy lieutenant of Somerset. In
1830 he was living at Roseville in Chilton Polden and had become an
obsessive collector of antiquities, architectural fragments and
furniture from a wide local area, including Glastonbury Abbey.

The original portion of Chilton Priory, being the tower, refectory and
oratory, was built in 1839 to incorporate and house his collection, and
also to serve as an eyecatcher from his residence, which was a Masonic
meeting place and a guesthouse; one Halliday was installed as a warden.

On Stradling’s death his collection — of which a catalogue survives —
was dispersed and the building allowed to deteriorate. In 1902 a Mr
Kennedy bought it and selected Frederick Bligh Bond in 1909 to build an
additional domestic wing in Tudor domestic style. Kennedy lived there
until 1918.

In that year it was purchased by John Maltwood, whose wife Katherine was
a noted sculptress; she is better remembered today around here as the
promoter of the Glastonbury Zodiac. Bligh Bond was again commissioned to
make alterations and to improve the gardens.

It was sold again in 1939, by which time the amount of traffic on the
A39 was significantly detracting from its attractions, and falsely
attributed by the estate agent to mediaeval origins. Having passed
through various ownerships, it has been long unoccupied but remains well
maintained and preserves some interesting stone sculptures and stained
glass from Stradling’s collection.

The Chilkwell Street fragment
-----------------------------

Tim Hopkinson-Ball went on to talk about an interesting carved fragment
from the Abbey that he spotted in 2005, used to decorate a fireplace at
43 Chilkwell Street. It had been rescued from a rockery in the garden,
and had previously been removed from an interior wall of the house.

It comes from a late-mediaeval screen, dating from 1490 to 1520, and
consists of the top left portion of a two-light opening. The spandrel,
though weathered, contains a branch with foliage — perhaps a wild rose —
and a shield containing a ragged staff and two cruets: the arms of
Joseph of Arimathea.

Another fragment from the same screen is in the Glastonbury Abbey
museum. This one was discovered by Bligh Bond in his excavations at the
Abbey. Precisely where has not been recorded, but it is believed to have
been found in the north transept where it may well have formed part of
the Loretto chapel that was mentioned by Leland.
