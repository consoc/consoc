A new glass-and-stainless-steel bridge across the Lady Chapel crypt in
the Abbey was opened by Lady Gass, the Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset, on
February 9.

Details of the vaulting can now be seen, for the new bridge goes
straight across the crypt rather than hugging its walls like the old
wooden one, which dates from about 1975. The new glass bridge has a
wider section in the middle where visitors can stop and contemplate the
view without blocking pedestrians behind them.

The new bridge cost about £45,000, funded by a bequest.

Conservation work on the Abbey's main south pier is almost complete, and
scaffolding will come down soon.

New Friends group to visit French twin abbey
--------------------------------------------

Friends of Glastonbury Abbey, launched on February 13 with Lady Gass as
president, plans an August trip to the twinned abbey at Maillezais in
France.

Two French visitors attended the launch in the town hall.

The stated aims of the Friends group is to promote understanding, use
and involvement of the Abbey within the community and further afield.
Its programme will include events, talks and special excursions such as
the one to the Vendée region of France in August.
