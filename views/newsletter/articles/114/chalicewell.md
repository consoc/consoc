Tracy Cutting has been on the Chalice Well staff since 2003, on the
archive committee and personal assistant to the guardian; on October 22
she gave members of the Conservation Society an outline of the well’s
history.

Excavations in 1961 revealed that the natural spring was originally four
metres below the current surface. Flints and potsherds showed that the
area had been in use since the mesolithic period, when freshwater
springs were revered as a source of life. A watching brief in 1999
during construction of a meeting room also produced evidence of Bronze
Age activity.

The first written reference is in the Great Chartulary of 1210, when the
spring is referred to as the “chalkwell” — hence the modern Chilkwell
Street — and was enclosed by a wellhouse to protect it from landslides
and silt buildup, and used as a supply for the Abbey.

Near the left of the main visible face, one column of windows does not have the same spacing as the columns either side of it, but are rather more closely spaced. Tall hills are visible in the distance behind the building. Two people stand wearing hats on the right of the photograph, behind the hedges and in front of a tree. A child stands at the corner of the building, somewhat dwarfed.">

Built as an inn in the 16th century, Torr House stood at the foot of
Wellhouse Lane, next to Chalice Well. It was a Catholic seminary from
1867 until Alice Buckton bought it in 1913. The building was finally
demolished in the 1970s. This old postcard view is from Coursing Batch,
coming down the hill.

A 16th-century inn, The Anchor, later called Torr House, stood on part
of the site, where in 1751 the taking of the waters by one Matthew
Chancellor of North Wootton with claims of healing powers resulted in
the construction of a spa house, of which some remains survive, as an
adjunct to the inn. Water was piped to the Pump House in Magdalene
Street, but Glastonbury’s fame as a spa was but short lived.

In 1867 a French and Belgian Roman Catholic order, the Brothers of the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, purchased the inn and established a seminary,
which lasted until 1913.

It was purchased at auction by Alice Buckton, a schoolteacher from
Haslemere who established a hostel and college for women, with a growing
emphasis on sacred drama. She raised the profile of the spring, naming
it the Chalice Well. The community acquired additional properties and
became known for its work in the Arts and Crafts tradition and
especially for the plays and pageants she produced, notably the silent
movie in 1922 featuring 400 townspeople.

On her death in 1944 a trust was formed to continue her work, but
financial difficulties forced the sale of many of the properties and in
1959 the nucleus of the site to Wellesley Tudor Pole, whose own Chalice
Well Trust was merged with Alice Buckton’s and continues to this day.

The Chalice Well is a chalybeate spring, rich in iron oxide, which
colours the water red. This connects with the legend of Joseph of
Aramathea bringing the chalice from the Last Supper to Glastonbury and
with Arthurian legends. A vision manifested to Tudor Pole in 1906
resulted in his sister discovering an ancient glass bowl at Beckery, now
kept at the Chalice Well and considered by some to be sacred.

The well lid was given by Frederick Bligh Bond in 1919 and incorporates
his interpretation of sacred geometry — the *vesica piscis*, two
intersecting circles, each passing through the centre of the other.

Today the Chalice Well is visited by tourists and pilgrims from all over
the world for its healing properties, mystic significance and as a
sacred space.
