Chairman’s report

Your committee has met regularly over the past year to conduct the
society’s business, arranged by our secretary, Janet Morland. Public
meetings have been arranged by Terry Carmen with backup by Anne. We were
fortunate to have Teresa Clark to respond to planning consultations, and
her departure from the town will be missed. Our long-serving treasurer,
Dennis Allen, has been invaluable, as has Ena Allen acting as our
newsletter secretary. Adrian Pearse has been a regular contributor to
the newsletter, covering lectures, and we are indebted to our editor,
Jim Nagel.

Alan Fear has done stalwart work clearing footpaths, together with Neil
Stevenson, enabling the Mendip District Council footpath officer to
repair and necessary.

Other committee members have contributed time and expertise, such as
long-serving John Morland with photography, who now wishes to retire.
Thank you, John, and congratulations on your book. Joe Joseph has left
the district. We understand his fields at Stonedown will be in good
hands.

As always, tree-planting has been a major activity directed by our
vice-chairman, Ian Rands, most competently, bringing many helpers
together. Your committee carries on but needs new blood, so please come
forward!

Notable events during the year included the restoration of the Market
Place corbels, in particular the Betrothal Couple, by grant aid and
public subscription. The carvings are important.

The footpath from Dod Lane up Chalice Hill is now mud-free, thanks to a
£3,400 grant from the Community Access Fund. The new owner of Bushy
Coombe is Rory Weightman; making it a wildlife area, he asks dog-owners
to clean up after them.

The footpath guidebook, *Glastonbury Footpath Walks*, was reprinted and
continues to sell well. We were consulted by the Levels and Moors
Partnership about upgrading of footpaths. Our comments were exhibited at
Baltonsborough Village Hall. Out of this arose the bid to the Somerset
County Council Community Access Fund to upgrade the Bushy Coombe public
footpath leading to the Tor. <span class="ednote">[Work started in January is now
complete.]</span> We are considered a responsible body to administer the
£3,400 grant. This has been possible to arrange thanks to the permission
of the owner, Rory Weightman, who tells me the work on the gothic
coachhouse at the top end of the coombe is progressing well. It was at
one time at risk.

Ian Rands and I attended the Green Flag awards presentation at Taunton
as guests of the Civic Trust. Very stimulating — a nice lunch and
escorted tour of the winning project, Vivary Park. Basically the awards
are for the provision of beacon green spaces available to the public
with no entrance charge.

Belated congratulations to all who helped with Glastonbury in Bloom, for
their success and continued hard work.

More than 28 people attended the annual general meeting of Glastonbury
Conservation Society on November 26 at St Mary’s church hall; most of
their names are listed in the minute book.

The minutes of the last AGM, on Friday 21 November 2003, were
distributed for reading and accepted.

The Chairman gave his report. Ian Rands reported on trees planted during
the year and to be planted this winter, and thanked John Brunsdon for
hospitality at committee meetings and Terry and Anne Carmen for
refreshments for tree-planters. Dennis Allen presented the accounts for
the year.

The officers were re-appointed unopposed <span class="ednote">[listed
below]</span>. The
following were re-appointed to the committee: Ena Allen, Neil Stevenson,
Roy Coles, Bill Knight, Neill Bonham, Alan Fear, Adrian Pearse, Terry
Carmen, Anne Carmen, Martyn Webb. We thanked John Morland, Joe Joseph
and Theresa Levell Clark, who have resigned from the committee, for
their contributions to the society.

Other business:

- It was suggested that Conservation Society leaflets and newsletters
  be put in every local estate agent’s office.
- The dying state of Gog and Magog, the ancient oaks at Wick, was
  mentioned. The society has planted a row of 135 oak trees to replace
  them, recognizing that they must eventually succumb.
- The newsletter was praised for being informative.
- Richard Raynsford moved a vote of thanks to the Carmens for
  refreshments.

After the formal meeting, Tony Nott gave [an interesting talk on the
vanished civic buildings of Wells](/newsletter/articles/114/wells-lost-buildings/).
