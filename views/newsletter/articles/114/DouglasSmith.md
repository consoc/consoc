Douglas Smith, 1937–2005, one of the society’s founders [Barrie Hudson]{.by}

Doug Smith

We are sad to hear of the death in January of Douglas John Smith. Born
in 1937, Doug practised as a chartered surveyor in Glastonbury for 40
years, initially in the practice of Hudson and Smith, and latterly as
the lead partner of Douglas Smith Partnership, the architects at 66 High
Street, until his retirement in 2004.

The practice specialized in renovation works, in the town and the wider
Somerset area. Doug’s careful attention to detail in renovation was his
hallmark, and his death at the early age of 67 is a sad loss to the
profession and to his wife Angela and his family. His monument remains
in his architectural work during his long service to his clients and the
fabric of the town.

The packed memorial service, full of light-hearted anecdotes about him,
was at Priddy church.
