An excellent talk on the eccentric architect Frederick Bligh Bond
(1864–1945) awaited members of the Conservation Society who attended the
Antiquarian Society’s annual general meeting on November 12 in the
library.

Dr Tim Hopkinson-Ball, whose doctoral thesis (University of Kent, 2003)
is on Bligh Bond, concentrated not on Bond’s interest in the paranormal
and mysticism, for which he is probably best known, but on his
substantial achievements as a talented architect. He gave a full account
of Bond’s family circumstances, professional life, successes and
troubles.

He has brown hair with a side parting, and is clean-shaven. He smiles slightly. He wears a brown jacket over a dark V-neck sweater, a hatched white shirt, and a patterned red tie. Behind him is an ornately carved stone archway.">

The slides were of particular interest, from Bond as a rather wistful
young child, to Bond as an old man beside the ruins of Glastonbury
Abbey; this was one of only two surviving stills from the film that was
made of the Abbey restoration nearly a century ago.

Other slides were of Bond’s elaborate civic buildings, and a very rare
early colour photograph taken by Bond himself of a handsome house he
designed.

Bond’s interest were wide. He experimented with the scientific
development of photography, was a keen mathematician and wrote copious
curious poetry.

In Somerset he did much church restoration work, as at St John’s,
specially on rood screens, inspired by a fragment excavated from the
Abbey. In Glastonbury his best known work is the war memorial beside St
John’s Church and the cover for the Chalice Well.

We look forward to Dr Hopkinson-Ball’s book on Bond with the greatest
interest.
