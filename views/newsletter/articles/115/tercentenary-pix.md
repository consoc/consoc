To help celebrate the tercentenary of Queen Anne granting the town
its charter in 1705, the Glastonbury Conservation Society hosted an evening
at the town hall on Wednesday March 30, to hear Dr Robert Dunning, the
county and Abbey historian, explain how Glastonbury, unlike many other towns, came to
have a mayor. Around 150 people including VIPs turned out to hear the talk.

The macebearers demonstrated that contrary to popular belief, the mace
is not used to bash the heads of the unruly: “**This** is what you do,”
said Mr King, swinging the much more lethal handle end into your
photographer’s unsuspecting midsection and **then** bashing him.

Tom Billing, town councillor and deputy mayor, will become Glastonbury’s
300th mayor this spring. Behind him in the council chamber of the town
hall is the portrait of the first Recorder (1705–08) of Glastonbury,
Peter Lord King, Baron of Ockham and Lord High Chancellor of Great
Britain, through whose influence the charter of incorporation was
granted to the borough by Queen Anne in 1705. The painter was Sir
Godfrey Kneller (1648–1725).
