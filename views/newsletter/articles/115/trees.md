Who donated this year?
----------------------

- Jan Morland: Monterey pine, 10ft plane
- D.C. Gardner: oaks and walnuts
- Gwen Jepps: 2 yews
- Ashton Otton: petisfora
- Clifton Brownes: walnuts
- Randses: hazel, sycamores and ashes
- Our faithful anonymous donor: 10 oaks, 10 ashes, 5 field maples.

These trees, plus some others from Chew Valley Trees, were planted down
at the Butler carnival site along Common Moor Drove.

And who planted them?
---------------------

This year, on several occasions, we have had the best turnout of
volunteers ever: John Brunsdon, Terry and Anne Carmen, Horst and Shirley
Elsebach, Janet Morland, Alan and Debbie Fear, Adrian Pearse, Keith
Matthews, Richard Raynsford, Joe Keers, Andrew Bond, Tara Weightman and
his brother, Derek Hankins, Stuart Marsh, Bob and Hilde Senior, Ian and
Carol Tucker, Nathan Pritchard and your correspondent.

We helped at Carymoor by planting 200 of their trees on the landfill
site where our waste is buried.

Apples
------

Many landowners in Somerset are grubbing out their cider-apple orchards,
but we are seeking to replace this loss by planting varieties for eating
and juicing. Somerset must keep its orchards. How would the tourism
attract the trippers to the area without blossom in the spring and fruit
in summer and autumn?

Over the past five or six years we have planted 1,025 fruit trees: all
in straight lines to look like traditional orchards, but by types in
clusters to simplify the harvesting. A small percentage of plums, pears,
damsons, quince, cherries etc are permitted.

This last winter we put in 55 in Bushy Coombe, 7 in Cinnamon Lane, 30 at
Chalice Well, and we are negotiating for a further 60 in Bulwarks Lane
and Wick Hill for next winter.

To all who have helped in these works — thank you.

Grants: apple trees
-------------------

To mark 300 years of Glastonbury’s charter, your committee saw fit to
offer a grant (over and above the £10 per tree given by County Hall) of
a further £10 per tree.

We felt that apple trees along Bulwarks Lane, in Bushy Coombe, along
Cinnamon Lane and at the Chalice Well would enhance the environs of our
town.

These plantings brought our total for this year to 445 and the grand
total since the Conservation Society started planting trees 30 years ago
to 33,745.

Now that the sun is shining and evenings are staying lighter longer,
what better way to enjoy the beautiful countryside than by walking one
of Glastonbury’s country footpaths?

I am looking for volunteers to walk a footpath at least once a week, to
keep brambles at bay. If there are any other problems with the footpaths
just let me know. If you would like to help, please ring me
([83 3185](tel:+441458833185))
and I will do my best to find a footpath local to your house.
