Planning permission has been asked for six houses in the steeply sloping
garden of Edward James at the beginning of Roman Way. Three of them
would share the existing driveway, and there would be two new entrances
from the road. Plans include a double garage for each house.

Mr James had permission years ago for two houses but did not take it up.
The rest of Roman Way is already built up on both sides, and the
Conservation Society has raised no objection to the plan.

The Holy Thorn is on the other side of Wearyall Hill, over the brow from
the extreme top right of the first photo and then a dozen feet down.

Holy Thorns of the past
-----------------------

This specimen was planted in 1952. It replaced one planted by the mayor,
Henry Scott Stokes, in 1951 to mark the Festival of Britain year but
which died.

The original Holy Thorn of the Joseph of Arimathea legend stood much
further along Wearyall Hill, near number 60 Roman Way, where there is a
memorial seat. For centuries Roman Way was the main road to Bridgwater,
and there is written evidence of stagecoaches stopping there for
travellers to take a sprig of the tree. The site is marked as “*spina
sacra*” on a 17th-century gunnery map hanging in the foyer of the Town
Hall.

The Conservation Society planted a Holy Thorn — which is always a graft
onto native hawthorn rootstock — at the ancient location in the 1970s
but it reverted to common hawthorn.

The current site, nearer to Hill Head and overlooking the town, started
with John Clark laying a stone slab there in the early 19th century.
