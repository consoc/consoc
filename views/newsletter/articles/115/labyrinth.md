The labyrinth pattern is found all over the world. It is a meditative
exercise, whereas a “maze” is a puzzle.

It’s back to the drawing board for a labyrinth that was to be built as a
Tercentennial project. Mendip council had given the green light for it
in the recreation ground at the top of Fishers Hill, where Bere Lane,
Hill Head and Butleigh Road meet. But at a meeting called on April 4,
some neighbourhood residents objected, some quite vituperatively. The
committee is now seeking a different site.

The labyrinth pattern is universal, said Sig Lonegren, the author of a
number of books on the subject; he lives in Bovetown.

“It is found in Indonesia, India, Scandinavia (more than anywhere in the
world, especially Sweden), the Hopi lands in Arizona, Peru and Crete.
There are ‘turf mazes’ all over England. The earliest examples are on
coins from Crete dating from 500BC.”

Chartres Cathedral in France has a famous labyrinth; other examples are
in Ely and Norwich Cathedrals in this country. They are thought to
stimulate right-brain activity (intuition rather than left-brain
intellect).

In modern usage, the word *maze* means high walls (like at Longleat) and
multiple choices, whereas a labyrinth has low walls and leads in only
one direction: inwards.

As for a Tercentennial labyrinth somewhere in Glastonbury, he said:
“There is still an iron or two in the fire, but nothing is certain.”

The construction envisaged for the Fishers Hill site was two-inch-wide
blue lias sunk just below grass level so as not to impede a lawnmower —
like the stones placed to outline the ancient foundations in the Abbey.

in the 1990s, is now in its fourth edition (Gothic Image Publications,
