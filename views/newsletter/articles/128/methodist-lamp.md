The wrought-iron lantern and supporting arch at Glastonbury Methodist
Church in Lambrook Street have been restored, thanks to a generous grant
from the Conservation Society.

The work was undertaken by Darren Frisby (DWF Metalcraft). The lantern,
arch and gates were the only ironwork to survive the Second World War.
The fence up the path was taken to help the war effort.

This work was part of the Access project by the church, to make a ramped
path to the front entrance. The lighting was improved and added to, and
the lantern was rewired.

A new noticeboard (left) has also been added to the bank over the
fountain.

This fountain (not in photo) has interesting and unusual carvings in its
stonework. We are hoping that Bristol Water, which owns the fountain and
the reservoir behind it, will do some restoration work in the summer.
