- For £1 the county council has acquired the St Bride’s mound, near the
  Brue, from the Southwest Regional Development Agency, for public access
  to it. Nothing remains above ground of either the chapel or priest’s
  house, which were excavated by John Morland in 1889 and again by Philip
  Rahtz in the 1960s.

- The RDA planted more trees alongside Street Road at the site of old
  cycle sheds.

- Urban Splash is conducting a feasibility study — six months? — into
  reusing the redbrick buildings, whose demolition was blocked by
  protesters in January.

- Mendip Housing signed a deal with the RDA on February 19 to refurbish
  the 12 empty cottages in Beckery Road, built in the 1930s to house
  Morland workers.

The proposed Tesco-on-stilts at Wirral Park, as it would appear from
Street Road. The architect (Saunders Partnership, Bristol) shows
aluminium glaze and larch timber for the outside walls and windcatchers
and skylights on the roof. The site already has planning permission for
2,000 sq metres of food sales. This plan totals 5,000m², which includes
non-food sales, a cafe and warehousing. Compare the present Morrison
store, about 1,700m².

Avalon Plastics would be the first new building on the Morland site. The
sketch shows a 5,000-square-metre factory — a big plant — at the site’s
main entrance. (The brightest traffic signals in Somerset, on their 15
bendy poles, are not shown.) Behind it, left, is the proposed Tesco
where the present plastics factory stands. Cyril Driver moved Imco (=
injection moulding co) to Somerset from London during the war; it became
Avalon Plastics in 2003.
