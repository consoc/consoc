The third instalment of Eric King’s recollection of Glastonbury shops as
they were around 1940. We start now at the top of Benedict Street and
walk up the north side of the High Street. (The illustrations here were
not in the printed newsletter.)

The editor has inserted names of present-day shops \[summer 2000\] to
help readers identify the premises. Unfortunately for postmen and anyone
else trying to locate them, almost none of the shops in this section
display their street number on the outside!

On the corner we have Heaphy’s, a large millinery shop on two floors.
The owner was C.V. Heaphy, a mayor of Glastonbury and also the
superintendent of the Methodist Sunday school.
<span class="ednote">[Graftons wine bar; previously Heaphy’s wine bar]</span>

Collihole’s, next door, was a very high-class grocery shop with a
restaurant on the first floor, approached by a very impressive stair in
the centre of the floor. Many local people purchased their beef dripping
which in old money cost sixpence a pound.
<span class="ednote">[Demolished in 1960s. Zapps newsagent]</span>

Next we come to William Graves’ fruit shop. This was later owned by Roy
Cox.
<span class="ednote">[Also demolished; now a used-book shop, on three floors]</span>

Next is the King William pub. For many years this was run by the Rice
family. Their daughter Edith became a mayor and alderman of Glastonbury
— also a freeman.

These detailed drawings are on a scroll rescued from the papers handed
over by the old Glastonbury Borough Council when Mendip District Council
was formed in 1974 (many of the borough’s other papers were lost in a
flood at Mendip’s offices). The draughtsman is unnamed. A clue to the
date is the sign for “Westminster Bank Limited”: it became National
Westminster in 1970.

Across Northload Street was an old building whose curtains were always
drawn; a few pots were displayed in the window. I was never sure of the
use of the building.
<span class="ednote">[In Harmony With Nature—hemp shop]</span>

Next came Butcher Halls. The shop was later taken over by the Co-op.
When Mr Halls left the business he moved into Restholme in the Wells
Road (now called Chindit House) and ran it as a guest house.
<span class="ednote">[Stephens the butcher]</span>

Next was Christophers’ sweet shop, run by two brothers. They also had a
warehouse in Butts Close and supplied sweets to the wholesale trade.

<span class="ednote">[3, Heartfelt Trading]</span>

Then came the Crown Hotel. It was run by the Dibble family, father,
mother and son Alec. In later years it was run by George and Madge
Griffin. The front bar was always used by the regular customers. One
such regular was Waiter Higgins. You could set your watch to nine when
he arrived every night. He had a regular seat and no other customer ever
sat in his seat; he sat in his corner smoking his pipe and very rarely
entered into the conversation.
<span class="ednote">[Glastonbury Backpackers hostel]</span>

The Westminster Bank was next; the manager was Mr Treleor.
<span class="ednote">[National
Westminster Bank]</span>

The George and Pilgrims next was owned by Mrs Richards, and later on by
Garth Holbrook. It was an expensive hotel and was very smart in those
days. The back bar of the hotel attracted some of the local characters,
and it was most entertaining just to sit in the bar and listen to the
conversations of Dr Morse, Edmund Carter, Keg Mapstone, Jack Chislett,
Jones, and Bert Hillard, to mention just a few of the entertainers.
Market day was most entertaining when all the local farmers gathered to
have a drink and relate their experiences. I only wish I had a
tape-recording of the conversations that took place in those times.

This is the middle section of what is actually a paper scroll about
three feet long.

We now come to Lloyds bank. The manager was Mr Jefford, a very quiet
person. Their daughter Barbara Jefford became rather famous as an
actress.

A narrow passage next to the bank led to the health centre. TB was quite
common in the days following the war and a number of people attended for
treatment. It also served as a clinic.
<span class="ednote">[Unique Publications, Shades & Characters, Richard Pelham stained glass, ... —now numbered from St John’s Square]</span>

Wright’s dress shop came next. It was run by Norman Wright, his wife and
sister Joan. They were members of the same family who ran the
ironmonger’s shop further up the High Street.
<span class="ednote">[5 High Street, Speaking Tree bookshop]</span>

Frisby’s shoe shop was next; Bill Maddiford was its manager.
<span class="ednote">[Galatea restaurant]</span>

The International Stores was next, quite a large shop. Provisions lined
one side and groceries the other. You paid for your purchase by
presenting a ticket at the cash desk on your exit.
<span class="ednote">[7, Gothic Image]</span>

The Tribunal was next, not as well used in those days. As far as I
remember it was never opened to the public but was used as a store for
items found in the Abbey.

A very good toy shop came next, called Goodall’s. It was run by a
husband and wife but was taken over by Curry’s just before the war.

<span class="ednote">[Orthodox Way]</span>

The Midland Bank manager was Lewis Green.
<span class="ednote">[HSBC Bank]</span>

A further clue to the date of the scroll: the chemist’s sign (far right)
says Hodder, whereas Eric King recalls it as Deacon’s.

A very popular pub called the Monarch was next, run by Austin Lukins and
his son Harold, who now lives in Bere Lane. The bar was used by a number
of locals who paid nightly visits. A stranger coming into the bar caused
the conversation to stop. The locals were Harry Janes, Bill and Bete
Foster, Arthur King, Cyril Sparks, Den Lukins, Les Jones — they all sat
in their usual seats each night.
<span class="ednote">[Passageway to small shops; Art of Africa]</span>

Next was the dentist, Mr Bevis, quite a short person, very quiet and
always appeared to be more frightened than his patient, especially when
he extracted your teeth.
<span class="ednote">[17, Passageway to Rainbow’s End restaurant; Dragons]</span>

Next came Tulley’s, the photo shop, later owned by Higden. It was left
empty during the war and used by the army, in particular by the
Americans as a medical centre.
<span class="ednote">[empty]</span>

We now come to the old Post Office; it moved from here about 1937.
During the war it was used as the local ARP report centre, staffed 24
hours every day by wardens, messengers and telephonists. It was also
used as the Food Office, where one obtained ration books. Behind it was
the Glastonbury telephone exchange — it was of course manual and
consisted of three operating positions. It remained here until after the
war, when the new automatic exchange was opened behind the new Post
Office.
<span class="ednote">[Barclays Bank]</span>

Next came Deacon’s, the chemist.
<span class="ednote">[Crystals]</span>

I must include Church Lane, the narrow footpath between the chemist and
the church, which becomes Norbins Road at its far end. The town
chimneysweep lived at the end house near the church tower; his name was
Mr Sweet
<span class="ednote">[St John’s Centre]</span>.
Next was a glove factory owned by Brookes, and next again a small school run by
Mrs Morris
<span class="ednote">[both demolished, today an open paved area]</span>.

We now arrive at St John’s Church. Vicar Lionel Smithett Lewis will
always stand out in my memory. He was often seen riding around the town
on his bike and usually providing some poor person with goods.
