Remember the town-centre enhancement in 1995: new pavement slabs to
replace ugly asphalt? With red bricks among them to add colour?

Probably not, because everything underfoot has been uniformly grey and
grimy for years, and we avoid looking.

Well, the High Street footpaths are getting a much-needed cleansing —
not just a daily sweep but a thorough annual scrub. Connaught
Environmental, on contract to Mendip council, carried out a pilot scheme
in Shepton Mallet last year, making the town look so much cleaner that
the programme is now being rolled out across the whole district. It will
work its way down from the Queen’s Head at the top of the High Street
over the next few weeks. Let’s hope those bricks will turn red again.

Meanwhile Steve Brown, who happens to live opposite where this photo was
taken and came out to say hello on his day off, carries on his everyday
round of picking up litter and sweeping footpaths.

Mendip won the British Cleaning Council’s award in March as the cleanest
district in Britain. “Cleaner streets are one of our top priorities,”
said the councillor in charge.
