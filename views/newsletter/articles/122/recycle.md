Plastic and cardboard could soon be included among the material
collected from Glastonbury residents for recycling. Mendip started a
pilot scheme in October involving households chosen at random throughout
the district, and results are being coordinated with Somerset Waste
Partnership.

Meanwhile residents can take plastic bottles to Morrisons carpark or the
household recycling centre at Street. Plastic items marked as type 1, 2
or 3 within the triangular recycling symbol are taken — which generally
covers bottles of all sorts. Margarine tubs, vegetable and meat
packaging and so on fall into types 4–7 and are not yet recycled.

Somerset recycled 40% of its waste in 2005–06, a doubling of the figure
from four years before. A single seven-year contract is to be signed in
October covering the whole county, replacing the present 10 separate
contracts for waste and recycling for each district.

Local-government groups are lobbying supermarkets and producers to cut
down at source on the amount of plastic waste.

In Canada, for years, retailers must charge a deposit on plastic
bottles, and people can return them to where they bought them.
