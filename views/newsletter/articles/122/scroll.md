A scrolled-up petition to the town council about the Abbey surprised
Maggie Stewart last week when it fell out from behind books. She lives
at 51 Chilkwell Street, a house known to exist in 1300 when the Abbey
was in its heyday, and has no idea how the document came to be there.

19 years after the Church of England bought the Abbey, the borough
council wanted to buy the land between the Abbot’s Kitchen and Magdalene
Street to use as a carpark. There was opposition:

“The petitioners view with alarm and disfavour the proposed purchase,”
says the document, dated December 1926. “Although a cheap tourist
traffic might be stimulated by the provision of the further space for
motors, the place would be vulgarized and the better class of visitors
disappointed.”

The first signatories were at 6 Buckingham Gate, London, and the rest in
Bath — which the document cites as a town “which has acquired a new
lease of popularity through the preservation and restoration of its …
antiquities”. It seems this was radical thinking at the time.
