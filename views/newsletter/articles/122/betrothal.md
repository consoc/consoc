Both the beloveds in the 500-year-old stone corbel in the Market Place
again have both arms.

The “Betrothal Couple” carving has had to have yet another repair. The
man’s left arm was broken off on Carnival night last November — John
Brunsdon had arranged for an inspection that night. Through hasty
overnight clearing-up, the arm was never recovered, despite appeals in
the press.

Ben Sabran, a local sculptor, carved a replacement arm and fitted it
using a stainless-steel pin. Lawrence Kelland, a conservator, did the
final modelling and repairs in lime mortar to match the stone and
applied a coloured lime “sheltercoat” to protect it from the weather.

This lovely little corbel, along with its neighbour, has enriched
Glastonbury Market Place for 500 years. It was cleaned and conserved in
2004, and the woman was given a new right arm — it had been missing for
many years.
