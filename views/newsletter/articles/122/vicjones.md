With the passing of Vic Jones this winter, Glastonbury has lost a great
character. Born in Snowdonia, he arrived in the town during the war and
became more “Glastonbury” than many Glastonians.

He was especially knowledgeable about Bere Lane, from when it was still
a lane and before it became a national A-road. He wrote about the
characters who lived in the lane and the many activities that took
place, and the grand elm trees at Abbey Farm across the road.

A Dunkirk and Normandy veteran, he was a standard-bearer of the British
Legion, collecting thousands of pounds each year for the Poppy Appeal.
He was devoted to Beryl, the local girl he married, and worked most of
his life at Morlands, serving in its fire brigade.

Latterly he was appointed macebearer to the town council, which greatly
pleased him.

He “adopted” neighbours’ dogs for regular walks and always kept a bowl
of water at his gate in Bere Lane covered by a slate.

In the early days of the Conservation Society, when planting trees in St
John’s carpark, it was Vic who operated the pneumatic drill to break up
the asphalt — and the quiet of a Sunday morning! He continued delivering
newsletters to the end of his life, apologizing for their being “a
little late” as he had not been very well.

Goodbye, Vic. Thank you. And we will miss you a lot!
