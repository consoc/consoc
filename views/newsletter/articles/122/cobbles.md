Fine new paving leading to her shop next to the Assembly Rooms is thanks

What an improvement to the alley leading off the High Street to the
Assembly Rooms, splendidly cobbled! Thanks is due from the whole town to
Ruth Morland of Glastonbury Galleries (out of sight to the left), the
landowner, who funded most of the £8,500 job. And then she added new
planting tubs.

Contributions came from others who share access: the Assembly Rooms,
Emma Howe the clairvoyant, the flat above Bishopston Trading, and Ricky
Bologna, owner of the Yin-Yang shop, who lives in Spain. The work was
done by Lee Pearson (LP Surfaces) of Walton, using Chelsea Pavers stone.

O that Church Path could be next, from the High Street to Norbins Road,
where hundreds of schoolchildren and parents walk four times a day on
dreary multi-patched asphalt. Whatever happened to Mendip’s plan to
continue the attractively paved footpath from St Benedict’s School
through all the carparks right up to the Wells Road surgery? This is all
within, or on the boundary of, the Conservation Area.
