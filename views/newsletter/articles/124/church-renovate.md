Both of Glastonbury’s parish churches are proposing the most extensive
interior reorderings that have taken place in 150 years. In both cases
the idea is to clear away the fixed Victorian pews, leaving a flexible
space that would allow a range of community activities.

This would return the buildings to the open appearance they had several
centuries ago. Cathedrals and most Orthodox churches have never had
pews.

Traditionally, the rector (in both Glastonbury parishes that was the
Abbot, and now the Church Commissioners) is responsible for the upkeep
of the chancel, set aside for worship, and local people built the nave,
the main body of the building. The nave was the town’s largest covered
space and was used for everything from festivals to markets till the
Reformation and Victorian reserved-for-religion attitude set in.

St John’s and St Benedict’s PCCs (parochial church councils) have both
decided that changes today are essential if the church buildings are to
survive for future generations. Small congregations and other financial
supporters cannot alone bear the burden of maintaining a Grade I
heritage building; moreover, the church’s purpose is for all in the
parish.

After several years of discussion, architects showed proposals in
October to church and public meetings. Detailed measurements at St
John’s enabled computer-generated views from all angles. Pews would be
removed and the floor made level throughout. The movable altar could be
placed more centrally. Glass inner doors under the tower would let the
great west door be open for a view down the whole length of the church.
A gallery floor in the west end would have rooms for interviews and
offices, with glass walls to let light through. A new low-level vestry
outside the north door — for robing, choir practice, storage and
accessible loos — could have a turf roof.

Proposals at St Ben’s are at an earlier stage. Acoustically, the
building is better than St John’s for concerts, and flexible seating
would be an improvement over pews. Kitchen and loos would be made in the
tower and present vestry.

It’s happened before
--------------------

Neill Bonham put a historical context to the proposals in his
illustrated talk, “Five centuries of change at St John’s”, in the church
on Friday (November 9). Neill has been part of St John’s for 46 years,
for many years as a churchwarden, and studied his predecessors’ records
going back hundreds of years.

The theme of his talk was how attitudes to worship and life after death
have shaped what people do in churches and why successive ages furnish
them as they do. The medieval church had many chantry altars with
priests paid to pray for souls in purgatory — more was spent than on
modern insurance. The Reformation swept altars away, along with rood
screens, frescoed walls and stained glass. Box pews and pulpits and
organs and a gallery in the tower came and went, and John Cammell’s tomb
trekked to all corners.

The last major refurbishment was in 1857 by George Gilbert Scott (in the
news as his St Pancras station reopens, high Gothic and hi-tech). His
pews have stayed put but his pulpit and font and the organ, and Mr
Cammell, have moved often.

Friday’s talk was to about 60 members of the Glastonbury Antiquarian
Society plus visitors. A fuller report will appear in the next
newsletter.
