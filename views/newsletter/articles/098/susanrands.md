Susan Rands has recently had a book published about the friendship of
John Cowper Powys, the Lyon family of Ilsington on Dartmoor, and W.E.
Lutyens, younger brother of Sir Edwin Lutyens, the architect.

Powys is well known for his novels such as *A Glastonbury Romance* and
*Weymouth Sands*. Susan’s book contains much new material about his
life.

*Powys Heritage* by Susan Rands is published by Cecil Woolf and is
available at Dicketts in the High Street and at West Side Bookshop in
Sadler Street, Wells.

She has also completed a biography of Lady Susan O’Brien, who grew up at
Redlynch Park, near Bruton. The eldest child of the first Earl of
Ilchester, she shocked society by marrying the actor William O’Brien, a
friend of Garrick. Outraged relatives arranged for the couple to live in
America but after six years they returned and finally settled at
Stinsford House near Dorchester.

Susan O’Brien left a fascinating, detailed journal and many of her
letters survive. Of special interest are those to her niece Eliza, who
was the mother of the photographer William Henry Fox Talbot, of Lacock
Abbey.
