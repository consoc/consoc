Seven houses are to be built at the bottom of Bove Town — planning
permission was given two years ago (see [Newsletter
110](/newsletter/articles/110/hollies-inspector/)), and one of the
conditions was an archaeological investigation. Charles and Nancy
Hollinrake, consultant archaeologists who happen to live just across the
road, began digging on July 27 and finished on October 7, with a team of
up to eight people. This is their preliminary report.

The site was filled by gardens until tennis courts were laid down in
the 1950s. The Hollies, the house at No 1 Bove Town, was leased to
Millfield School as a boarding house until recently and will now become
flats.

Some of the features discovered on the site show that Anglo-Saxon
people were living in Glastonbury in planned streets, said Charles
Hollinrake. “There was some planning; it was not just
higgledy-piggledy.”

The archaeological team at work — in September, before the rains began —
on what was the tennis courts at The Hollies, Nº 1 Bove Town. The mound
at top right is hundreds of years of garden soil. Stretching diagonally
from it to the bottom of the photo is evidence of a boundary ditch that
lasted from as early as AD1000 until the 19th century, when the present
big house was built and the Bove Town cottages were demolished. Wells
Road is behind the hedge at top.

We first investigated by means of a series of evaluation trenches in
2004. These revealed that the site contained not only evidence for
medieval occupation, including boundary ditches, but also features and
finds dating to the late Anglo-Saxon period — broadly the 10th and 11th
centuries.

The survival of archaeology from the 10th or 11th century in medieval
towns is rare, so the county council recommended a full archaeological
excavation of the development area. This we did during the summer of
2005.

The finds are still being processed, and the phasing of the site is
still to be completed, but this article outlines the main finds and
occupation periods.

A very large number of archaeological features were recorded on this
site, predominantly boundary and drainage ditches, gullies, rubbish pits
and post-holes. The sheer density attests to continuous occupation from
at least the 10th century.

The earliest feature was a pit from the Late Bronze Age, probably
from around 1200 to 1000BC. A few features seem to contain Late Iron Age
pottery shards (the features themselves may be of later date). Roman
pottery shards were discovered, as residual finds in Anglo-Saxon and
medieval features.

Anglo-Saxon occupation on the site has been proved beyond doubt.
Property ditches and drainage gullies indicate that pre-Norman
settlement was probably contained within regular, laid-out plots running
off the west end of Bove Town. The Anglo-Saxon property alignments seem
to share orientations slightly different from those of the 12th-century
and later planned town.

We did not find Anglo-Saxon buildings. They probably stood on the
Bove Town frontage, not investigated during the excavation, and they
were probably more-or-less destroyed when the end of the road was
widened during the 20th century. Anglo-Saxon finds include a
considerable quantity of pottery shards, an iron-link chain and an iron
or steel pruning sickle used for harvesting grapes.

Medieval occupation seems to have continued through to at least
the 16th century. Notable finds include a 10th-12th-century stone lamp,
a late-12th-century silver coin of King Roger II of Sicily (found in a
14th-century layer) and a number of very large pits whose backfill
included many fragments of pottery kiln waste and rejected pottery
shards — kiln wasters. These indicate the presence of a pottery kiln in
the vicinity, although not within the excavation area: it operated from
at least the 13th century through to at least the 15th century. This is
the first unequivocal proof of medieval pottery production in
Glastonbury.

No medieval building foundations were seen during the excavations.
Again, these probably lay above the Anglo-Saxon buildings on the Bove
Town frontage. During the 16th or 17th century, most of the property
reverted to a deeply cultivated garden, although it was still divided
into long, medieval, burgage plots with buildings standing on the street
front. These buildings were demolished in the second half of the 19th
century, when the area was landscaped and an orchard planted.

The medieval pottery shards appear to contain a high proportion of
elaborately decorated glazed wares, possibly indicating that the site
was occupied by well-to-do inhabitants.

Dr Lynn Marston, in her PhD thesis \[Leicester University, 2003\]
on the town, covering the years 1086 to 1400, suggested that this part
of Bove Town, and this particular plot, may once have been occupied by
hereditary abbey servants or customary tenants from the Anglo-Saxon
period onwards. She further suggested that this area might once have
formed the eastern end of the pre-Norman High Street area.

The 2004 excavations offer strong support to her theory: finds such
as the Anglo-Saxon sickle and the Sicilian coin. The plots themselves
also seem to reflect the same orientation as those on the High Street.

The Bronze Age pit is the first known prehistoric feature found
within the town (about 1000BC). Along with the ditch from the late
Neolithic period (2200BC) found at the Chalice Well in 1999, this pit
does indicate that prehistoric occupation features are present and can
be found in Glastonbury.

<p class="ednote">[From Chairman’s Notes]</p>

At last the Grade 2 listed building known as The Hollies has had an
overdue redecoration inside and out. This significant late-Georgian
house was until recently used by Millfield school as a boarding house.

It stands on an important site at the bottom of Bovetown, which was
the medieval route to Wells. Archaeologists found evidence that confirms
human settlement at Glastonbury in prehistoric times. They also found
Anglo-Saxon features of a sort that can give radiocarbon dates — which
is actually quite rare.

Dr Tom Pinniger lived here in the 1950s and 1960s and ran his surgery
from the premises in the days before the health centre. Dr Pinniger was
a slightly built man with a glass eye. This commanded great respect from
children, since he could “look” in two directions at once!

He began practice on a motorbike and retired driving a large Humber
saloon. Once he slipped and broke his thigh on the lias-slab floor. He
nevertheless completed the surgery and then called an ambulance.
