Background to the project
-------------------------

My personal motivation for beginning independent research into
Glastonbury’s potential as a World Heritage Site (WHS) was sparked by a
desire to protect the town and its many sites of environmental,
historical and spiritual significance from the relentless process of
piecemeal development threatening the integrity and health both of
landscape and of community.

A WHS bid seemed to offer a big opportunity to build community and
unity — a wider civic pride among local people in this unique place with
so much of its extraordinary natural and cultural heritage still intact
but clearly much endangered, not only by ignorance and greed but also by
permissive planning and development laws and regulations.

Indeed it is hard to see where opposition to such a bid might come,
save from property developers and landowners or those concerned about
the practical costs or difficulties of actually obtaining the cherished
goal of World Heritage status.

For myself, six months down the line, I would put pride of place in
the bid not simply in conserving Glastonbury’s history, archaeology, or
landscape or architecture, or indeed in building sustainably, tourism or
business opportunities, but rather in focusing on developing wider
local, regional and national recognition of Glastonbury’s worldwide
reputation as a centre for spiritual pilgrimage.

Glastonbury — or the Isle of Avalon — has been a major pilgrimage
site and “sacred land” for centuries, if not for several millennia,
thanks to the Tor, the Well, the Abbey and many other sacred sites. And
we haven’t even mentioned a single myth or legend yet! Glastonbury has
so many sites of great universal appeal and potency to add to its claims
as a spiritual or pilgrimage centre of international renown.

And nearby on the Levels are two of the best-preserved and most
internationally renowned Iron Age lake villages to bolster Glastonbury’s
case.

Glastonbury appears a very potent brand name indeed when set beside
some of the other rather less illustrious names on Britain’s current WHS
Tentative List — places such as Chatham Naval Dockyard, the Liverpool
commercial centre and waterfront, the Wash and the north Norfolk coast,
and Manchester and Salford (Ancoats, Castlefield and Worsley).

The Somerset Levels might be more difficult to establish as a brand,
but linked with Glastonbury (and the two are surely integral to each
other historically and geographically) they are likely to bring wider
appeal to the whole package.

What is a World Heritage Site?
------------------------------

Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization) has accorded this status to 754 sites worldwide, as being
of “outstanding universal cultural or natural significance”. (See
[whc.unesco.org](http://whc.unesco.org/) for the set of criteria.)
Of these sites, 23 are in the UK, including Bath, Stonehenge and
Avebury, and the Dorset and east Devon coast (Jurassic coast). This
year’s successful nominee was the Cornish tin mines.

These sites are nominated by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) on behalf of our national government — the maximum is one
site per year — and assessed by international specialist bodies and
accepted by Unesco’s World Heritage Committee onto a list World Heritage
Sites. In the UK, WHS status offers no additional statutory protection
or financial aid, but it does highlight the international importance of
the site and the need to ensure its survival for future generations.

How is a World Heritage Site managed?
-------------------------------------

In the UK, WHS status is a “key material consideration” that local
authorities must take into account when making planning decisions. All
World Heritage Sites are required by Unesco and the UK government (DCMS
and English Heritage) to have a detailed management plan for the site,
which aims to provide a framework for conserving its cultural and
natural-heritage assets. Such a plan must also outline issues relating
to the management of change within the site and in any surrounding
“buffer zones”. The plan is drawn up and updated by a WHS Steering Group
representing a partnership committee of the widest possible range of
community “stakeholders”, both locally and nationally.

How can WHS status be obtained?
-------------------------------

To be nominated by the UK government, a site first has to be included on
the national Tentative List of sites likely to be put forward in future
years. This list, first drawn up in 1987, was last reviewed in 1999,
when 25 sites were included — 8 of which have duly gained WHS status
while 17 remain on the current list.

On September 2 in 2000, I was advised by Caity Marsh of the DCMS
International World Heritage and Listing Branch that the government is
preparing to review the Tentative List for the first time in seven years
in 2006-07 and will carry out “a major and lengthy consultation to
consider all claims for inclusion on a future Tentative List”. Such a
consultation represents a window of opportunity for potentially new
claimants such as Glastonbury and the Somerset Levels.

No clear guidance exists yet as to how this review will be organized,
but Caity March and Dr Christopher Young of English Heritage have
advised that greater emphasis will now be put on “establishing clearly
at the outset that the place in question has outstanding universal value
and authenticity through the development of Statements of Significance,
Authenticity and Integrity” (Dr Young provided background information on
the form and nature of such statements).

Caity Marsh (DCMS) stressed that the ability to demonstrate
“widespread community support and ownership” of a WHS bid will be a key
factor in determining the success or failure of any bid to go onto the
Tentative List and any bid later for full World Heritage Site status.

Where do we go from here?
-------------------------

With a review of the government’s Tentative List due to begin next year,
there is clearly an opportunity for interested individuals and groups to
come together to consider whether to prepare a bid for Tentative List
status — with a view to obtaining full World Heritage Site status within
the next decade — say 2012 to 2015.

If there is a positive will to do something, then a steering group
involving community and national organizations, perhaps with their
chairmn and an administrative coordinator or researcher, will need to be
established. The group can act as a reference point for all those
interested in a bid for WHS Tentative List status and also seek to
awaken and nurture community interest and support for the project.

As part of this process of bidding for List status, the steering
group will also be required to address the issue of the availability of
resources and an effective strategy to compete for full WHS status from
2008 onwards. The steering group’s job will be to create community
ownership and leadership and the practical resources to enable an
effective and compelling case for Glastonbury and the Somerset Levels to
be submitted to the DCMS Tentative List review by early 2007 at the
latest. And then, we hope, we will be in a position to bid for an even
bigger prize from 2008 onwards: full World Heritage Site status.

**Motion before the Glastonbury Conservation Society annual general
meeting on Friday 2 December 2005, proposed by Anthony Ward and seconded
by Nathan Pritchard:**

This AGM recognizes that Glastonbury Conservation Society, as the main
source of education and practical support for conservation in the
community in Glastonbury, is best placed to promote awareness of the
potential conservation benefits and costs of World Heritage Site status
to the wider community.

This AGM acknowledges and supports further research into the
potential conservation benefits and costs for Glastonbury and the
Somerset Levels to bid to join the Tentative List of potential World
Heritage Sites in the UK when the Government (DCMS and English Heritage)
review and revise their list of potential sites in 2006-07. This AGM
asks Anthony Ward and other interested members, including a
representative of the Management Committee, to form a small research
group to continue this research on behalf of the Society.

In particular this AGM:

1. invites Anthony Ward and a member of the Management Committee to
arrange a meeting as soon as possible with representatives of the
Glastonbury Community Development Trust and Somerset County Council (the
county archaeologist, Bob Croft, and the Levels and Moors Project) who
have both already registered an interest in World Heritage Site status
with DCMS and English Heritage. All those in the Society interested in
being part of the new WHS research group to attend if possible. Aim: to
share views and information and to consider how serious an interest such
bodies have in a potential Glastonbury and Somerset Levels bid (or
separate bids).

2. asks the new WHS research group then to prepare to convene a
public information and discussion meeting at the Town Hall in spring
2006 for all community organizations in Glastonbury who may have an
interest in a World Heritage Site bid beginning in 2006-07. Observers to
be invited from key Somerset Levels organizations, and expert speakers
to be invited from existing World Heritage Site steering groups in the
South and South West.

3. If there is evidence of widespread community support for a World
Heritage Site bid, a WHS steering group can be set up at the public
meeting to begin the formal process of preparing a Glastonbury or
Glastonbury and Somerset Levels bid for the World Heritage Site
Tentative List in the government’s planned 2006-07 review process.

4. No financial or other commitments to be made at this stage by the
Society or research group beyond such an exploratory public meeting.
