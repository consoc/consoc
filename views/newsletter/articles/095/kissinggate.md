Following a suggestion by Alan Levett, the committee decided to pay for
the installation of a kissing gate at the bottom of Bushy Coombe, to
match the one at the top end of the public footpath.

Paul Bannell of General Engineering, who had repaired the top gate for
us several years ago, made it and, with the help of George Steer,
installed it.

A plaque to mark the occasion was obviously required, and this was cast
by Richard Bowditch of Mendip Alloys at Dulcote. It says:

> Presented to the town by the Glastonbury Conservation Society in the year 2000

And it was formally presented to the mayor by our chairman at midday on
March 27. We believe that it is a worthy millennium project. Please go
and have a look at it.
