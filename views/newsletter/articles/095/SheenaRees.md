People from all over the district brought injured birds to Sheena, and
she nursed them at her home. A retired social worker, she lived in Roman
Way for many years and later in Bere Lane.

Sheena Rees died after a short illness in January. She would have been
76 on April 13. Her ashes were scattered on the shoulder of the Tor on
Palm Sunday.

She had devoted her life to the care of injured birds and must have
nursed many hundreds back to a longer life. As a local vet I would be
required to help treat birds from time to time. Sheena would then take
them over and painstakingly nurse them until they could be released
again.

One such case was a kestrel that had broken its wing on Wearyall Hill in
1976, on August 3. I set the wing, immobilizing it by bandaging to the
bird’s body. Then Sheena took over for hospitalizing and feeding at her
home, at that time in Roman Way. As the kestrel had a leg ring I was
able to trace that it had been rung at Portsdown, Portsmouth, that year
on June 23, and I sent Sheena the official report. She was delighted,
writing:

> *September 18*
>
> Thank you for the sight of this information. I have
> taken a photocopy for Mrs Lowe and myself. I am pleased to report that
> the kestrel is flying — and hovering — satisfactorily with her mate on
> Wearyall again. I have Mr and Mrs Watts of Camelot, Hill Head, bringing
> her the odd dead day-old chick till she is fully self-supporting.  
>
> *Sheena Rees*

May Sheena fly with angels — and her birds.
