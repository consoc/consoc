Eric King’s is one of the voices on **Tracing the Map**, the programme
by Glastonbury Net Radio about the High Street through the past century.
You can hear it at the library or through the internet. This is Part 1
of 4.

The editor has inserted names of present-day shops [summer 2000] to
help readers identify the premises. But so many shops fail to display
their street number on the outside!

I was born in Glastonbury, 67 Manor House Road, in 1927 and apart from
my army service between 1945 and 1949 I lived in Glastonbury until 1960,
when we left to reside in Bournemouth and then Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. We
returned to Street in 1997.

The following are some of my memories of the High Street, the shops and
in some cases the people. I am casting my mind back to the old days
before, during and after the war.

Facing down the High Street one must remember La-La Comfort. He was
always known as La-La because of his initials, L.A. He ran a small
garage a short distance from the High Street along the Wells road
<span class="ednote">[new health centre]</span>
and also a cycle shop at the top of the High
Street on the right-hand side. For many years he was the chief of the
Glastonbury fire brigade.

I will start at the top of the town and walk down the left-hand side of
the High Street, and then return from the bottom up the other side.

<figcaption>
Butcher Edwards was still at Nº 90 when these photos were taken in 1949.
In the early 1970s this was the Pat Li-Shun shop, with huge flowers
painted on its front.

Butcher Edwards ran the first shop on the left at the top of the High
Street. He was never without a cigarette in his mouth with a long ash on
the end, most of which ended up in the purchaser’s meat. His charge was
based on the amount he felt one could afford, and this sometimes
depended on the clothes one wore when purchasing his meat. The cattle
were slaughtered at the rear of the shop.
<span class="ednote">[This is 90 High St, today a charity shop.]</span>

Passing down on the left, after a private house, we come to Jim Westkin.
He ran the fruit, veg and seed shop. The seeds were weighed on purchase.
He was one of the top players in the town band.
<span class="ednote">[86, Colin Foster insurance]</span>

Bill Fear was the landlord of the Queen’s Head. All the pubs were
so-called locals — the same regulars usually made a nightly visit. Bill
was the warrant officer in the local Air Training Squadron; he was the
drill instructor and many of his local cadets then eventually passed
into the forces.

<figcaption>
Miss Taylor was still selling sweets at Nº 82; this building and
cottages behind it were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a car
showroom that became the Co-op supermarket. A current planning
application [2000] would make it an Arthurian interpretation centre.

A narrow passage led to a row of small cottages towards Silver Street,
and next we come to Miss E. Taylor’s sweet shop. She would often be seen
standing in the door of her shop dressed in her apron.
<span class="ednote">[82, now Factory Shop]</span>

Next we come to the first of the two large Georgian houses. The first
was run by Mrs Appleby, who ran a guest house. It also contained the
Avalon museum
<span class="ednote">[80, W.J. Ayles furniture]</span>.
Adjoining was Dr
Willcox, who lived in the house with his sister and ran the doctor’s
practice from here.
<span class="ednote">[78, Alma (Parsons) Flats].]</span> Later the
small cottage next door was converted to a waiting room.
<span class="ednote">[76, Tom’s Take-away]</span>

In the Congregational chapel next door, many old residents will remember
the Boys Brigade run by Mr Bawdon.

Then was Gillards boot shop.
<span class="ednote">[74, Robert Frith optometrist]</span>

Next came Flemington’s cake shop. The bread and cakes were baked at
Street
<span class="ednote">[Video Nites]</span>.
A dress shop was next door
<span class="ednote">[70, Solo II hair design]</span>].</span>
I think
Leslie Dowdney lived in the peaked house below
<span class="ednote">[Eyetech optician; Tor Pet Supplies]</span>.

Offices were located in the house on the corner of Victoria Buildings:
the Upper Brue Drainage Board and Harold Alves, architect.
<span class="ednote">[66,
Douglas Smith, surveyor]</span>

The house on the opposite corner of Victoria Buildings was used as a
showroom for Chamberlain’s furniture shop.
<span class="ednote">[The Curtain Pole]</span>

Miss Corps’ sweet shop came next.
<span class="ednote">[62, Elaichi Tandoori]</span>

Cecil Dowdney, a very fine organist and also one of the sons of Butcher
Dowdney lived in the next house down the street. His son, Jack, still
lives in the house.

We next come to Wright’s. The cottages[] were used as stores
mainly for Aga cookers
<span class="ednote">[60, 58, Abbey Mews]</span>.
The double-fronted shop was next. They were very good ironmongers and
builders merchants, and one could obtain almost all one required in that
line. They were the agents for Aga cookers. One of the sons, Ted, ran
the shop with Stan Blacker as his assistant. It was rather like Fawlty
Towers: utter confusion everywhere. Ernie Wright, the father, and his
son Wilf ran the building side of the business; the yard was situated
behind the shop into Silver Street. The goods were delivered by horse
and cart by a one-armed person called Twister Chivers.
<span class="ednote">[54, Top of the Crops; 52, Excalibur café]</span>

For many years the steward of the Con Club was Jim Maidment, who could
often be seen walking many miles with his dog.

We now come to Harry Appleby, the butcher. I remember his huge
side-whiskers. His wife worked in the office and took the money as
specified on the ticket supplied with the meat. The cattle were
slaughtered at the rear of the premises.
<span class="ednote">[48, Cheltenham & Gloucester building society, closed this March]</span>

Next door we come to Brains. Firstly was the gents’ outfitters run by Mr
Bawdon and next down the ladies’, where dresses and materials were sold.
The shop was run by mother, father and son.
<span class="ednote">[46, launderette; 44, Glastonbury Gifts and Crafts]</span>

Next we come to Stacey’s garage, serving petrol over the pavement. The
garage was later owned by one of the employees, Ernie Hodges.
<span class="ednote">[Batmink sound & light]</span>

Next we come to Chamberlain’s, a furniture shop run by father, mother
and daughter.
<span class="ednote">[42, Thomas Cook travel agency]</span>

Cullen’s, a dairy next door, was well known for delicious ice cream.
<span class="ednote">[Penny Juniors]</span>

We again come to Stacey’s, this time a cycle shop. It was owned by the
garage proprietor, who resided over the shop.
