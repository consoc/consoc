Other business
--------------

### Tribunal

Donald Martin felt that his complaint last year about
the Tribunal being a drab place for the Tourist Information Centre was
not reported properly. He feels that the Tribunal should be a museum and
the TIC should move into the empty shop next door.

Dennis Allen then gave a resume on the reasons why the TIC is in the
Tribunal. He also said that 80,000 people go into the centre every year.
Martin Lofthouse also explained the situation: the Tribunal is one of
the most historic buildings in Glastonbury and plans are being made to
improve the lighting.

### Travellers

Martin Lofthouse mentioned the problem of travellers
as they cause environmental pollution. \[Chairman’s note: This matter is
being attended to!\] Ian Cairns, the gypsy liaison officer, has said
that many are homeless, and homeless single men have very little chance
of being rehoused.

### Names for paths

Jan Morland suggested that the path from Bulwarks
Lane through Ten-Acre Field to Wellhouse Lane should be named Karen’s
Path and the Oak Row should be Rands’ Row.

### Clean pavements

Jim Nagel asked whether a pressure-washer could
be used to clear grime (not to mention chewing gum) from High Street
pavements. Not long ago we had sparkling new paving stones and the brick
details were red, but now all is grey. The meeting passed a vote of
**thanks** to Steven Brown for his faithful work in keeping the town
clean.

After the AGM business, Alan Cotton gave a talk on the history of the
postal services in the Glastonbury area.
