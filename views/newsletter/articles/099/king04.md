This is the fourth instalment (held over from newsletter 98) of Eric
King’s recollection of Glastonbury shops as they were around 1940. We
started at the top near the Queen’s Head in Part 1, walked down the
south side of the High Street to the Abbey gatehouse, then came up
through the Market Place as far as the church. We now complete the walk
back to the top.

The editor has attempted to insert names of present-day shops \[summer
2000\] to help readers identify the premises. Unfortunately for postmen
and anyone else trying to locate them, so many shops — marked \# — fail
to display their street number on the outside.

Behind the church, St John’s school was for boys (St Benedict’s was for
girls). I still remember all the teachers with some affection; they
include Mrs/Miss Scammel, Kidd, Hayes, Hunt, Chivers and Spittle and Mr
Baker, Ford, Godfrey, Lucas, Whittaker, Young and Dobson.

We now arrive at the paper shop. It was owned by the Gilbert family and
was known as the Gazette Office. The weekly *Central Somerset Gazette*
was produced here, with its printworks at the rear of the shop. \[The
paper was bought by Clares in Wells in the 1940s, but the painted words
“Central Somerset Gazette office and printing works” were still visible
on the wall facing the church until it was at last repainted in the
1990s. The Gilberts’ daughter, Mrs Doris Welsford, ran the Abbey
bookstall for many years and still lives in the Street Road.\]
<span class="ednote">[Today,
Direct Offset carries on the print tradition at the back; Peaches and
Cream hair salon has part of the first floor; Whitehead News is in the
shop at 27 High Street]</span>

St George’s Hall was used by the church. Choir practice was carried out
here under the supervision of Gerald King and later by Sidney Masters.

The solicitors in those days really were Gould and Swayne. Mr Gould was
a very tall and smart person who lived in Chilkwell Street. He was the
town clerk and looked very impressive when he walked to his office down
the High Street. Albert Hembury was a clerk who worked in the office,
very well known in the town; he was known as the poor man’s solicitor.
\[Edwina, his widow, still lives in the High Street, further up.\]
<span class="ednote">[31, still soliciting as Gould and Swayne]</span>

After Archers Way we had a ladies’ and gents’ hairdressers and also a
sweet shop and tobacconist. It was owned by the Sparks family, and later
by Don Barber. Ken Moxham was a hairdresser; I recently met him in
Street. During the war it was taken over by Don, a hairdresser from
London. The parade in Archer’s Way had Larkworthy the grocer, a
fish-and-chip shop and Rachel Churchill’s clothing shop.

Next came London House, a large and impressive two-storey shop owned by
Brooks selling dresses and millinery. It was pulled down in about 1936
for the new Post Office to be built. One or two firms went bankrupt over
the building of this office, caused mainly by flooding in the basement.
The telephone exchange was built at the same time behind the Post Office
but the opening of the new exchange had to be delayed until after the
war.
<span class="ednote">[35: the Post Office does have a number!]</span>

The Glastonbury and Street Co-op was next. The original building was
modernized just before the war. An overhead wire system conveyed the
cash to the cash desk. Jack Dimmick was the manager for many years. Bert
Marsh, who is at least 90 years old, worked in the shop. He now lives at
Street.

Mr Bevis the dentist resided next door

The next house was later used by Dr Malin Boyd for his practice
<span class="ednote">[\#,
Beckets Inn\]</span>.

A small thatched shop
<span class="ednote">[43]</span> was next, selling sweets and the
like. It had been a butcher’s shop in the past. Ted Vincent’s garage was
next, serving petrol over the pavement. The garage and the thatched shop
were both burnt down and both became the new Vincent’s garage. It was
later taken over by Whites (whose garage eventually moved to Magdalene
Street) and then by Woolworth’s.

Sheppard’s wool and greengrocery shop at 51 High Street is now Abbey
Antiques, owned by the Browning family. The photo was taken in 1949.

Beyond a couple of houses
<span class="ednote">[\#, Rose Cottage; \#, Glastonbury Discount
Centre]</span>, the next shop was run by a husband and wife, Jessie
and George Sheppard. The wife sold wool and the husband greengrocery. It
was an awkward shop to enter because of the rather steep stone step at
the entrance.
<span class="ednote">[51, Abbey Antiques]</span>

Next came Saunders, an ironmongery and china shop. This closed just
before the war. Mrs King’s sweet shop was next.
<span class="ednote">[53, Avalon Ladies
Fashions, recently closed; 55, Hunab-Ku Portal Immortal; \#, J&GC
goldsmiths and silversmiths; 59, Satyamvidyan Centre for Integral Yoga
Studies]</span>

After one or two houses came a grocery shop. It was opened by Mrs
Melmouth and eventually became Westman’s cleaners.
<span class="ednote">[61, Cheung Sing

Mr Chamberlain, who was a painter and decorator and whose brother ran
the furniture shop, had a small painting and decorating shop at his
home.

After several houses we arrive at Comfort’s cycle shop, mentioned in the
first instalment
<span class="ednote">[71, former charity shop]</span>.

At the top of the High Street was the Glastonbury Arms, run by the
Baulch family. It was later taken over by Eddie Baxter, an evacuee from
London. The pub was demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the
present health centre
<span class="ednote">[its pharmacy, 73, is now Glastonbury Flower
Shop]</span>

<img src="../glasarmsG71.jpg" alt="In black and white, a large building painted white or another light colour on the corner of a sloping road. To the left of the entrance, above a window, is the lettering “Brutton’s Beers”. Above the entrance is a flower box, and above that is a sign which cannot be read in this photo. The roof is tall and tiled, and has a few chimney stacks. Telegraph poles and lines run along the right edge of the building.">
<figcaption>

The Glastonbury Arms, photographed in 1949, stood at the top of the High
Street on the bend into Wells Road. The lettering says Brutton’s Beers —
which were brewed in Yeovil from 1824 till 1965.

It’s clear that it is the same building as in the previous photograph, though taken at an earlier time. A gas streetlamp stands near the entrance, and some of the telegraph poles and lines are absent. The brewery name and sign above the entrance are also absent. A man stands at the corner, and visible on the road to the right are a horse-drawn carriage and a car from the early-to-mid 20th century.">

Baulch, on the [Lost Pubs
Project](http://www.closedpubs.co.uk/somerset/glastonbury_glastonburyarms.html)

the 1930s, and son of Simeon James Baulch, its last landlord.
