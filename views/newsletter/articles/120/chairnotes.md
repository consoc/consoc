Ian Rands, MBE
--------------

We were all delighted to learn of Ian Rands’ MBE in
the Queen’s birthday honours list. The citation was for contribution to
conservation in Somerset as vice-chairman of Glastonbury Conservation
Society. Woodland, hedges, orchards and rows of oaks all stand as
monuments to his organizational skills and hands-on hard work. Ian
modestly calls it a “collective award” and says he only represents the
entire team of volunteers who help plant trees. The date for going up to
the Palace to receive the insignia has not yet been announced.

Recent health warnings mean Ian has to slow down and hand over to Alan
Fear what has become a major activity of the Conservation Society.

Congratulations, well done, Ian, and best wishes.

Bushy Coombe
------------

he much-used public footpath to the Tor now has an
all-weather surface of stone chippings. This has been well received by
walkers and will be an enormous help when wet weather returns.

Commiseration to Rory Weightman, who disturbed hornets while strimming
in the coombe. He was stung several times and needed a hospital stay.
Obviously, the hornets did not like competition!

Winter talks
------------

A winter series of talks is being prepared as usual,
even though it has not yet been decided who will take over from Terry
Carmen as organizer. Please support our meetings, especially the AGM on
December 1.

Garden delight
--------------

Many thanks once again to Alan Gloak and Colin
Wells-Brown for an excellent evening’s hospitality at Coombe House
garden. The weather was kind and the garden brilliant, especially
considering the dry season. A joy to behold!

Artsweek
--------

Somerset Art Weeks — until September 24 this year — is
not only a chance to see displays of work by local artists and, in some
cases, to see them in action in their studios. It is also, of course, an
opportunity to visit some of the area’s heritage buildings that are not
normally open to the public. Catalogues are available from the library
and the tourist information centre.
