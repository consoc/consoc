Stephanie Morland has written to the Southwest Regional Development
Agency to point out that the original plans for some of the buildings at
the old tannery site still exist and “would provide such a good start
for renovating and updating”. Interesting features, such as brick arches
near ground level, are visible now that much of the site has been
cleared.

Bob Wilkey, the site manager until 2001, rescued the drawings — some on
linen — and deposited them at the county records office.

The architect in 1910 was William Reynolds, who also designed buildings
for Clarks in Street.
