As a bonus event for Somerset Art Weeks, a new art gallery opened at 8
Market Place. Work by nearly 50 local artists — ceramics, textiles,
jewellery, wood, photography, cards and paintings — are on display on
two floors.

Steve Rose and Dawn Sheffield had a partition wall removed to make the
late-medieval fireplace part of Gallery 8’s front room. They would like
to borrow old photos of the building to display. The couple met in
Somerset, then worked in London and Derbyshire, “and we always wanted to
move our business here”.

“Art is for everybody, not just snooty people,” she said. “We just do it
because we enjoy it.”
