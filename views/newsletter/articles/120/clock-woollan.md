The hour numbers engraved around the silver-coloured, partly tarnished, edge are in bold Roman numerals, between which there are decorative emblems, and there are minute numbers every 5 minutes engraved in italic Arabic numerals. The engravings are all painted black. Between the minute numbers are some extra engravings, spelling out “R. Woollan, Glastonbury”. The centre of the clockface is in a different metal, perhaps brass. One of the clock hands is visible and points to about the 24-minute mark. The hand is elaborate, with a hollow stylized moon shape making up part of its stretch, which then gives way to a dagger shape complete with hilt.">

I have looked after 30-hour and 8-day longcase clocks by Robert Woollan,
and changes in style support either a long working life, or Robert
senior and junior. I worked on one signed “Robert Woolland Jnr.,
Glastonbury” — spellings in those days were more casual.

The clocks are well made, quite robustly built, and two dials were
stylistically very similar to those by William Townly (1729–51) of Flax
Bourton and Temple Cloud. Townley — another spelling — also looked after
church clocks, so both men were clearly practical makers, not just
buying in (unless, of course, Woollan bought from Townley or
vice-versa).

I am pretty sure that some of the dials are from the same source.
Several of Woollan’s clocks have not survived in their original cases,
but one that has is in an oak case. Another reported to me in 1970,
owned by a couple in Canada, is in a walnut case. Maybe others were in
walnut and eaten by woodworm — or the walnut one could have been
recased.

Here are some entries from 17th- and 18th-century churchwardens’
accounts for maintenance of church clocks. The Butleigh church clock is
still in use. Fixed to it is a longcase “chapter ring” (as the
roman-numeral part of the dial is called, from monastic times), signed
Robt Woollan, Glastonbury: in other words, the face from a domestic
clock is attached to the mechanism inside the tower so that the man
winding it knows what time is showing outside.

I recall seeing old clockwork from St John’s tower in Glastonbury — made
by John Cuff in 1718, the precursor of the present electric mechanism
donated by our namesake town in Connecticut in 1967 — left outside the
church for scrap. This was just at the beginning of my interest in
clocks. It seems a shame to me now, for it would have been repairable. I
heard that someone rescued it, and would love to know who.

Matthew and Jan Willis dwell in Bove Town, and adopted a sustainable
lifestyle decades ago. Both care deeply about conservation and social
problems.

Matthew opted out of industry (systems analysis at Morlands) in 1968 in
favour of working with his hands: repairing and restoring antique
clocks. To help get him started, Denis Emery the jeweller sold Matthew
his duplicate tools. The jewellery shop, where Dicketts is now, still
traded under the name of Gillmore, its founder (who also made clocks:
Neill Bonham has a 19th-century wall clock with “J. Gillmore,
Glastonbury” on its face).

Matthew is now running down his clock-repair business. He wants to
transfer priorities to growing food, to cultivating trees for energy (on
a plot at Godney) and in general to being more committed about “living
lightly”.

Jan (*née* Lawson) is a competent painter. When deteriorating eyesight
hampered her, she turned to ceramic sculpture. Some of her work is on
display during Somerset Art Weeks (till September 24) at Dower House
Cottage, Wood Lane, Butleigh. Go to the Rose & Portcullis pub and follow
signs. “I’m in with nine other artists,” said Janet: “lots of variety, a
big field, a lovely view, a couple of studios.”

A photo of her ceramic sculpture of [St Hugh and his swan](../swans/)
appears on page 1 of this newsletter.
