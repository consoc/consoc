A family of swans was feeding in the rhyne beside the Baltonsborough
road, near Cowbridge, on Sunday afternoon as I cycled back from a
Somerset Art opening. In a car I would not have noticed them — nor the
hedgerows’ bumper crop of blackberries and blue sloes.

The mute swan (*Cygnus olor*) is Britain’s largest bird, and, at 50
pounds, it’s the heaviest flying bird. The male (cob) and female (pen)
look alike, and mate for life. The four grey-brown juveniles in the
photo will gain white feathers and a brighter bill in their first
winter.

St Hugh and his swan
--------------------

One of Jan Willis’s ceramic sculptures *(see below)* at that Arts Week
venue depicts St Hugh’s swan keeping his adoring fans at bay when he was
exhausted. He was prior of Witham, a Carthusian house near Frome, until
becoming Bishop of Lincoln on 21 September 1181; he died in 1200.

<span class="ednote">[Added 2018:]</span> At the time of the Reformation, Hugh was the
best-known English saint after Thomas Becket, according to a Wikipedia
writer. He is also known as Hugh of Avalon; he was born at Avalon in
France. He joined as a novice and rose to become leader of the Grande
Chartreuse order, known for its austerity and earnest piety.

By special request of King Henry II in penance for the murder of Thomas
Becket, Hugh was sent to become prior of the first Carthusian house in
England, Witham Charterhouse in Somerset. As prior and then as bishop,
he was adept in treating successive kings with firmness, charm and wit.
The people loved him.
