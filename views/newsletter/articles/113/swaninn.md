Update 2019: A reader of the website has come up with [new
information](/newsletter/articles/153/SwanInn)!

</aside>

The illustrations show a token issued in 1853 by the Swan Inn,
Glastonbury, but an initial examination of directories of the period has
failed to provide additional information.

*Hunt’s Directory* for 1848 lists in addition to a number of beer
retailers the following hostelries: the George Inn, the White Hart, the
Glastonbury Arms, the Queen’s Head, and the Rose and Crown in the High
Street; the Bell and Red Lion in Magdalene Street; the Lamb Inn in
Northload Street; and the Torr House Inn in Chilkwell Street.

Most of these are mentioned in *Kelly’s Directory* for 1861, with the
addition of the Crown, and the 1866 edition adds the Mitre.

Tokens were widely issued by public houses and tradesmen especially
in the 17th and 18th centuries to compensate for a shortage of small
change and thereby increase the number of transactions. However, by the
early 19th century production of low-denomination currency had greatly
increased, as seen, for example, in the ubiquitous “cartwheel” penny
weighing one ounce, and the need for such tokens declined, though they
continued to be produced and, as seen with this example, to the same
standard as the national currency.

This token is nine-tenths of an inch in diameter and unusually bears
no denomination.

Should any reader possess more information concerning the Swan Inn
and its location it would be appreciated for inclusion in a future
newsletter.
