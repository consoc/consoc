Wick Hollow
-----------

Wick Hollow is one of the remarkable beauty spots of Glastonbury. The
road continues up from Bovetown between steep banks of sandstone with
trees clinging precariously to the cliff face. The Tor Bus uses this
route, so it is increasingly seen by visitors.

Sadly, young people have excavated a large hole under the footpath
along the top, to such an extent that the highway authority has closed
the path (WS15/6 and 15/82) while considering ways of dealing with the
problem. Closure will inconvenience many people who regularly use the
footpath.

Please speak out and report instances of vandalism of this sort, as
they have serious consequences.

Bushy Coombe
------------

Better news about the Bushy Coombe footpath (WS 15/9), which becomes
slippery and quite dangerous in wet weather. It is on the busy and
preferred route up to the Tor by foot, avoiding the main A361 road.

The new owner of the coombe, Rory Weightman, has agreed to allow
repairs to take place, and Clare Haskins, the Mendip rights-of-way
officer, has put a scheme together.

Our society has made a bid to the county council’s community fund for
a grant to pay a contractor to do the work necessary. If the bid is
successful, the work could be done during the quieter winter months and
completed by March. We should know by November if the grant aid is
available, and we are in any case committed to tree-planting at the top
of the coombe this winter.

Rory Weightman is living in tented accommodation in the coombe
awaiting the conversion of the listed gothic coachhouse. This building
was on the Buildings at Risk register, so it will be good to see it
lived in and protected. The coombe is now run as a nature reserve and
will be managed accordingly.

News from the Tor
-----------------

Cattle have again grazed the Tor this summer, and the grass and
wildflowers are in good condition. The herd of cows with calves and
Devon bull are very quiet and well behaved. They are rather “untidy”
animals and have been removed at peak visitor times.

A concrete bench has been destroyed, and there was another graffiti
incident on the tower. Routine fence repairs are ongoing. Fortunately,
illegal camping, raves and drumming have not been a big problem this
summer. There are plans to replace the concrete apron round the base
of the tower.

News from the Abbey
-------------------

There are plans to form a “Friends of the Abbey” organization along the
lines of the Friends of the Abbey Barn. This has been prompted by the
visit from Maillezais in Vendée, which is twinned with the Abbey. The
friends association there plays a major part.

The Lady Chapel bridge project is back on the agenda again. Visitor
numbers continue to rise over and above the increase for the musical
Extravaganza in July.

Morlands
--------

The Beckery Island trust is formed and ready to take on the restoration
of the retained listed buildings. All the remaining buildings are likely
to go following a marketing exercise. Work on the road infrastructure
etc is scheduled for the new year.

Wearyall Hill
-------------

The James family, who own the eastern part of Wearyall Hill, have been
unable to find a grazing tenant this year, so the grass has grown long
and uneaten. This is very much a sign of the times — a reflection of the
state of farming.

Meanwhile the copse and its extension thrive. The view over the Morlands
site, especially towards the old Bailys buildings, is particularly
interesting.

Glastonbury’s 300 years
-----------------------

The tercentenary of the granting of the charter by Queen Anne,
establishing Glastonbury as a borough town, falls next year, 2005, so
watch out for special events. It is hoped to restore the Market Cross to
commemorate the event.
