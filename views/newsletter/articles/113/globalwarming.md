Recent emotive statements about the impact of human activity on the
biosphere include the assertion that there is “a third more CO<sub>2</sub> in the
atmosphere now than in 1860”.

To *estimate* the CO<sub>2</sub> fraction of the atmosphere with any accuracy
requires an immense network of sampling stations at all heights —
something we do not yet have. We had nothing of the kind, at all, in
1860.

Also, the CO<sub>2</sub> fraction is very small, so that any variation in the
estimates registers as a large percentage change. (Always beware of
“percentage changes” in statistics!)

<img src="../ocean.png" alt="A map of the world, with red and blue traces showing path and direction. A blue line runs southwest from the UK, past the Carribbean, and down the east coast of South America. It runs east along Antarctica, at which point it branches in two. One branch runs north, up the east coast of Africa. It turns red as it runs along the south coast of India and then southeast along the west coast of Malaysia. Meanwhile, the other branch runs further East along Antarctica, and south of Australia. It then turns north between Australia and New Zealand and into the northern hemisphere. It runs in a large clockwise loop east of China and west of America, and turns red. It then runs west, along the north of Papua New Guinea, and among the Philippines, Indonesia, and past Thailand. It rejoins the other branch. The current then runs southwest and west, past the south tip of Africa, then northwest. It runs close to the blue current running the other way on the east tip of South America, then runs north and northeast back to the UK.">

water circulates (so far) in the Earth’s oceans.

The question of the CO<sub>2</sub> fraction is thus plagued by statistical
spin and a lack of reliable data — and there is no rule-of-thumb which
can compensate for this. If the CO<sub>2</sub> fraction were to increase
significantly — and enhance the greenhouse-effect — more heat would be
retained in the weather-system, leading to faster evaporation from the
oceans, heavier rain or snow fall, faster replacement of the icecaps,
more rapidly moving glaciers etc. The system would be more vigorous, but
the temperature would not rise, because all of these effects involve the
transfer of latent heat (owing to the unique phase-change behaviour of
water). It’s a thermo-static, water-cooled system.

Worldwide precipitation data would tell us something — and enough
might even be available now to give us a rough indication — but do the
“climate-change” evangelists refer to it? Not a chance! Anecdotally, one
hears that the rains are failing in central Asia and north Africa (and
that English country gardens are about to become spiny deserts) — and
the doomsters are quick to cry “global warming!” — but, in fact, these
effects are the very opposite of those to be expected from more heat in
the system.

The only reliable gauge of global temperature, as opposed to heat
content, is the level of the sea (owing to the heat-expansion of water).
And sea level, despite the dire predictions of some, has obstinately
refused to rise at a faster rate than it has been rising for 10,000
years. Indeed, over the last ten millennia, the rate of the rise in sea
level has progressively slowed, and it appears to be still slowing.

Certainly there is no justification, in the current furore about
“emissions” and “climate-change”, for wrecking our economy, curtailing
our personal freedoms or subjecting ourselves to pan-continental or
global dictatorships — as some suggest we should.

Local conservation of beauty-spots and general care of our
surroundings — which I wholeheartedly support — are another matter
entirely.
