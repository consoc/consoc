Michael Masters of Edgarley Farm sold his herd of pedigree Friesian cows
on September 16. Eyesight problems forced him to quit, and the sale of
one prize cow raised Â£3,500 for Somerset Sight Fund.

Neighbouring Norwood Park Farm also ceased milking this summer. Only
one farm on the south side of the Tor is still dairying, compared to 14
in 1980.
