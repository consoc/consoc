A more effective maintenance programme for Somerset’s footpath network
will be possible when a new database comes online in 2005. Rights-of-way
officers will be able to do away with pen and paper, and the job of
copying information back in the office, by using handheld devices to
record data in the field.

The portable computer uses the global positioning system (GPS): it
calculates its exact location by comparing the time difference for
signals to reach it from from two or more satellites in orbit around the
Earth.

Officers will be able to note the condition of surfaces and furniture
on rights of way, and the database will keep track of paths that require
signposting or have issues about ploughing or cropping. And over time,
an invaluable historic record will be built up.

Fund to improve path network
----------------------------

The Community Access Fund is a £50,000 fund set up in July to help
improve Somerset’s rights-of-way network as well as permissive paths.
Community groups and parish councils can apply for grants of up to
£5,000.

Grants from the Community Access Fund can be used for physical works
such as changing stiles for kissing-gates or for non-physical work such
as producing leaflets about parish walks or special waymarks.
Projects have to be completed by the end of March.

West Somerset Coast Path work continues
---------------------------------------

Work is continuing to complete missing links on the West Somerset
Coast Path, which will connect the River Parrett Trail at Steart with
the Southwest Coast Path national trail in Minehead. Most of the West
Somerset path will follow the coast, but part will come inland onto the
Quantocks to avoid using the busy A39 road.

Coleridge Way opens in 2005
---------------------------

The Coleridge Way is to be open for walkers in 2005, traversing 40
miles of landscape near Nether Stowey to Porlock and Exford where Samuel
Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth drew inspiration for their
poetry in 1797.
