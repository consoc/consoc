Romulus and Remus amid the beeches, facing the TV mast above Wells. An
Italian prisoner of war sculpted it while working on the farm there. In
2008, English Heritage made a Grade II listing to protect the statue.
The Somerset Italian community has an annual celebration day around it.

It must be 14 years ago that Tom Todd made contact with the Conservation
Society. Responding to an advertisement, he phoned to say that he could
offer us some trees. Over the years he has given us more than 1,000
good, sturdy young beech trees, which are now planted and flourishing in
this part of Somerset.

He was a proud Man of Kent, and a humorous Grenadier guardsman. When
he settled in Somerset he chose the Beech Barrow on the hill above
Wells. The beautiful beeches on that hilltop shed a plentiful mast onto
a fertile soil. We are the beneficiaries of a generous donor. On what
was his land stands the Romulus and Remus monument erected by Italian
prisoners of war.

Tom marched on ahead and left us behind on July 11 — which was also
the day of this year’s Romulus and Remus celebration on his hilltop.

Tom died in the Wells hospital with many members of his family around
him. I attended his memorial service on behalf of our society. You will
not be forgotten, Tom; and your trees will be a widespread and lasting
memorial.
