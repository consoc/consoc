Those gathered in the Rural Life Museum carpark on a fine August
Saturday afternoon were but a small band, so Ian Rands’ plans for
separate routes were merged.

Heaving up the Tor was rewarded: the Mendip Hills, Brean Down and
Steep Holm just out of reach in the clear air. But the purpose was to
look at some of the society’s plantings, so still heady from the view,
and with a nod towards the orchard standards we put in three years ago
on the eastern slopes, we descended to Stonedown Lane. All but one
managed to resist the allure of the icecream van.

Then after a chairman’s proprietary inspection of parked vehicles
claiming disabled status, we moved down the lane to Joe Joseph’s field.
The hundreds of hedge plants there seemed to be doing well, and we
ambled our way down to stand alongside the ancient oaks Gog and Magog on
Wick Farm. The usual conjecture about age and prospects of these old
giants took place, helped by the assembled foreign visitors.

They stand on a narrow road lined by hedges and trees. Beyond the hedges in the background is a grassy field rising towards the distance, which after another row of hedges becomes much steeper and rises in a domed hill. At the very top of this hill a tall thin rectangular structure is visible with battlements at the top.">

Walking by the maturing plantings in the oak row was a pleasure, and
we could see the results of enclosure clearance and pruning work from
two years ago. By now we were nearing Higher Wick Farm, ready for a
rendezvous with Ian and Carol Tucker’s teatime hospitality, but briefly
delayed for the small excitement of Leslie’s dog Mack trying to herd a
field of bullocks.

The break helped prepare for the ascent of Stonedown Hill, now graced
with the hundreds of whips we planted in early 2003, their tubes and
stakes standing proud on the slopes, harbingers we hope of resurrected
woodland. At the hilltop we could see the recently replaced scots pines
in their fine enclosures, beyond them the young beeches on the western
flank, and to the north the high end of the oak row.

Up Paradise Lane, and then a diversion round the top of Bushy Coombe,
which was good for butterflies as well as orchard watching, and some
mention of plans for the 2004-05 planting. And finally back to the
carpark, as well exercised in conversation as legs!

Thanks to Ian Rands for providing clear maps and notes, to Richard
Raynsford and Joe Keers for volunteering as leaders, to John Brunsdon,
Janet Morland and Leslie Delamont (and her dog Mack) for supporting, and
to Ian and Carol Tucker for tea and delicious cake.
