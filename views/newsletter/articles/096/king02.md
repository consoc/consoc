The writer, Eric King, was born in Manor House Road in 1927 and lived in
Glastonbury until 1960. After retiring from work in Bournemouth and
Essex, he returned to Street in 1997. Eric King’s is one of the voices
on **Tracing the Map**, the programme by Glastonbury Net Radio about the
High Street through the past century. You can hear it at the library or
through the internet.

The editor has inserted names of present-day shops [summer 2000] to
help readers identify the premises. Unfortunately for postmen and anyone
else trying to locate them, so many shops fail to display their street
number on the outside!

<img src="../HighSt-H8677_800px.jpg" alt="A sepia view of Glastonbury High Street from a high vantage point. A grassy area is visible on the right, in front of which is a monument. The building beyond is labbeled “Hodders L”, and a sign reading “chemist” is protruding from it. The other side of the road has many buildings in many styles. One has a clock. Mid-20th-century cars are parked along the left side of the road, and a few are driving. A woman pushes a pram on the pavement on the right side of the road.">

This postcard photo plainly shows the part of the High Street that Eric
King covers in this second instalment, where he walks down the south
side of Glastonbury High Street, recalling each shop as it was around
1940 and the people who ran it.

The view appears to date from the early 1950s, judging by vehicles and
prams, but little would have changed in that decade. The photographer
(unknown) was likely atop the Helliker building (which had been the
Central Somerset Gazette office and printworks) next to St John’s.

W.J. Ayles, who was my uncle, traded in the shop that is still called
Ayles. They sold furniture, pictures and the like, as today. Upholstery
was carried out in the workshop by Mr Dibble. Coffins were made in the
workshop at the rear of the shop. My uncle started the business by
displaying a bedroom suite that he made for himself.

Next door was Goodsons, a family business. I first remember it run by
father, mother and son Lea and then later by another son Arthur, who
came out of London and became a mayor of Glastonbury. Again, on one side
was the men’s outfitters and on the other side ladies’ dresses and
materials.
<span class="ednote">[34&ndash;32, demolished in 1960s, now Heritage (Nisa) Fine Foods]</span>

Next we come to the Miss Alves’ sweet shop, run by two sisters. It was
our school sweet shop where we were pleased to have a halfpenny to spend
— but a penny in old money sent us over the moon.
<span class="ednote">[30, Ian Jeanes estate agent]</span>

<span class="ednote">[28, the Glastonbury Project office — in photo, the shop’s sign says
Summers]</span>

Miss Tomlinson’s hat shop was next down. Just before the war it became
St John’s Dairy, run by Bernard Slocombe and his wife.
<span class="ednote">[26, Cancer Research charity shop]</span>

<img src="../slocombeG71.jpg" alt="A stone building with a shopfront. The second storey is decorated with painted lettering, advertising clotted cream and Cheddar cheese. Other lettering says “sent by post”. Above the main shop window it reads “St. John’s Dairy”. To the right of the building is a narrow alley. To the left, attached, is a small shop, and the readable portion of its sign says “Summers”.">

Directly opposite St John’s Church was the dairy run by Bernard Slocombe
and family. In the 1930s it was a hat shop. At its left is the smallest
shop in Glastonbury, its signboard saying Summers. This photo was taken
in 1949.

Next to the lane is Vestry Hall. Once the church vestry, it was used as
the town council offices. It was occupied by the town surveyor, firstly
Mr Wingfield and then Stan King, and also by the sanitary and meat
inspector as he was then called, Hugh Hembury. How well our streets and
pavements were kept in those days! They all knew every inch of the town.
<span class="ednote">[Ralph Bending estate agent; upper floor is the Masonic lodge]</span>

Next we had the Deacon’s Kitchen, a very popular cafe with wonderful
homemade cakes. It was reputed to be the place where all the local
gossip took place.
<span class="ednote">[Spiral Gate café]</span>

Next we come to the Rose and Crown pub, run by the Vowles family and
son-in-law, again very much a local, famed for its darts team.
<span class="ednote">[Four Seasons]</span>

Next the Old Shopee, a fruit shop. It was known as Thankyouta’s as the
owner always said “Thank you, ta” when the transaction was completed.
<span class="ednote">[20, Palmer Snell estate agent]</span>

Next Theo Ginn, a tailor who made good-quality men’s suits. The shop has
retained his name.
<span class="ednote">[18]</span>

Next door we had another gent’s outfitters, Dennis, who again made
good-quality suits.
<span class="ednote">[Four Seasons]</span>

Next came Miss Taylor’s bakery, where the name Taylor is still spelled
out in mosaic tiles at the door. It was later owned by Harry Janes, who
worked for Miss Taylor for many years.
<span class="ednote">[Burns the Bread]</span>

Jack Voake, the butcher, was the next shop down. The animals went
through the shop to be slaughtered at the rear of the shop.
<span class="ednote">[Rag Tag and Bob’s Tale gift shop]</span>

Next we come to Harry Comer and his sister, a bakery and cake shop. The
baking was carried out in Silver Street. Boots the Chemist took over the
shop when Comers moved into a new shop in the Market Place where a
millinery shop, Stokes, had previously existed.
<span class="ednote">[10, Feng Shui Crystals; was Glastonbury Galleries till recently]</span>

We next have the Assembly Rooms. At that time it was owned by Morlands,
and was a popular venue for shows, concerts and the weekly hops, usually
costing about one shilling and sixpence in old money. The girls sat one
side of the hall and the boys on the opposite side. It was a long walk
across the room to ask a girl if she would dance with you — and an even
longer one back if she refused!

I just remember the next building being converted for use as the gas
showrooms and town library. Above the showrooms the borough treasurer,
Ebb Smeath, and the town rent collector, Mrs Ham, worked. It was also
the housing office. I understand that the building was previously used
by a family called Bloom.
<span class="ednote">[8A, Bishopston Trading; 8, Little Gem]</span>

Next we have Gillmore’s, a high-class jewellery shop run by Norman and
his father Joseph, a dapper man with a goatee beard. (Jewellers used to
do spectacles too. Norman’s son Keith qualified as an optometrist and
practised at 74 High Street till he retired.)
<span class="ednote">[6, Dicketts bookseller and stationer]</span>

Checkley’s came next, run by father and two brothers, Jack and Rob. It
was the only radio shop in the High Street. Rob took care of the radio
side and also provided and maintained the town firemen’s callout bells.
It was a very well stocked ironmongery shop with boxes behind the
counter displaying their contents on the fronts.
<span class="ednote">[Blue Note café; Wicked Wax; entrance to Glastonbury Experience courtyard]</span>

At the bottom of the High Street we had Cooper and Tanner, the
auctioneers who conducted the weekly market. Mr Tanner was a
white-haired man and always wore a bright-coloured bow tie. He lived in
the large house in Bovetown, Mount Avalon.
<span class="ednote">[2, Big Bargain Shop]</span>

Around the corner was another sweet shop, Wilkins. It had a brass
windowsill which was always kept highly polished.
<span class="ednote">[6 Market Place, Jon the jeweller]</span>

Next again was Leslie Hillard, a saddler much used by the local farmers.
The shop was later taken over by his son, Bert Hillard.
<span class="ednote">[7, Avalon Sheepskin]</span>

Around the comer was Miss Stokes, a fairly large millinery shop.
<span class="ednote">[8, National Federation of Spiritual Healers</span>
Comers moved to part of the premises from the High Street with their bread shop and
cafe.
<span class="ednote">[9, Crystal Star]</span>

Norman Squires the tailor was next. He made good-quality suits. His son
Richard still lives in Glastonbury.
<span class="ednote">[also 9?, Bristol and West building society]</span>

I have now come to the bottom of the left-hand side, as far as the Abbey
gate. In the next issue I shall start from the top of Benedict Street
and walk up the other side of the High Street.
