A friend of a friend sent me a copy of the Glastonbury Conservation
Society’s newsletter 117 (November-December). I was intrigued by the
reference to my father, Dr Tom Pinniger, and by the excavation of the
tennis court at The Hollies.

When my father first came to Glastonbury, on his motorbike, in the
early 1920s, he lived in a house in the High Street which was demolished
to make way for the “new” post office. We moved to The Hollies towards
the end of the 1920s. He lived there until his retirement in late 1963,
when he moved to Bath.

I love the story
<span class="ednote">[retold by John Brunsdon in <a href="/newsletter/articles/#newsletter-117">Newsletter 117</a>]</span>
of the magical “glass eye”, and so would he! In fact he
had very poor sight in one eye, which necessitated a very thick lens on
that side of the spectacles. I can imagine a child might well think that
eye to be glass — full marks for creative imagination!

As for the garden, we had one tennis court (grass), which was there
in the 1920s, and it lasted until the Second World War, when my father
decided it should be dug up to grow more vegetables. The higher lawn was
used for croquet, and in any case it would not have been long enough for
a second tennis court without excavation into the walled vegetable
garden behind. This upper lawn area was, I think, used by Millfield for
parking cars and coaches.

Incidentally, the rockery (at the top of the slope to the right on
leaving the house) used to contain some carved stones which my father
thought could have come from the Abbey on its dissolution. Some years
ago parts of the garden on the Wells Road frontage were lost due to road
widening, as was some shrub and tree ground on the Bove Town side.

My husband and I have not been back to Glastonbury for eight years or
so, but we are now thinking that another visit would be very
interesting.
