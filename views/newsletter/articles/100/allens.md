Dennis and Ena have closed their High Street giftshop and launderette
<span class="ednote">[and now live at 31B Hamlyn Road]</span>. We wish them
health and happiness in their well deserved retirement. Fortunately for
our society they are willing to continue as active committee members,
Dennis as treasurer and Ena as newsletter distribution coordinator. What
would we do without good loyal members like this?

More than 20 years ago Dennis was building footpath stiles with
Community Service offenders â€” in charge, of course! Then after
redundancy at Clarks, he and Ena took over a shop and post office near
Newton Abbot. After three years they returned to Glastonbury and became
very active with our society and local affairs generally. Dennis has
served on both district and town councils.

He was mayor during a very difficult period when there was unnecessary
oppostion to town-centre enhancement and stood firm regardless of
intimidation. Dennis has made his mark in tourism, both on Mendip and in
town, where he continues to chair Glastonbury Tribunal Ltd, which runs
the tourist information centre.
