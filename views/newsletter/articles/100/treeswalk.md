The Woodland Trust is encouraging organizations throughout Great Britain
to take an interest in trees, and suggests that societies like ours
should organize a walk. Its “Walk for Woodlands” seeks to bring to
people’s attention the importance of keeping their remaining strips and
patches of ancient woodland. So far some 90 groups have arranged walks.
Ours will be in the autumn.

A few months ago we gave our support to the purchasing of Loxley Wood,
out by Ashcott. We donated £500, and the Woodland Trust, with further
subscriptions from similar organizations, was able to buy the wood and
will now protect it from developers.

We propose to meet at 2:30 on October 21, a Sunday, at the kissing-gate
in Dod Lane, walk up Bushy Coombe, past the two small-leaved limes,
along the side of the Bulwarks Lane orchard and up to Maidencroft Lane.

Then turn right into Paradise Lane and follow the oak row down to Gog
and Magog. From there go north over Wick gully to the Paddington Trust
copse, uphill through Ian Tucker’s oaks, past the beech row to Bulwarks
Lane and back through both the kissing-gates.

Please join us. The walk is about four miles, but shortcuts can be
arranged at various points.
