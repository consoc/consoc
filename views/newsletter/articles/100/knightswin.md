Bill Knight’s fish restaurant in Northload Street has won a top quality
award from the Sea Fish Industry Authority.

The Seafish Friers Quality Award is presented to shops that meet
exacting standards throughout their business: not just good fish and
chips but helpful and friendly staff, hygiene and good practice in
handling and cooking food. Around 200 points are inspected, including
some 40 temperature checks.

Richard Chivers, the Seafish quality-assurance advisor, said: “Only
fish-and-chip shops which meet our requirements get the award, but I’m
pleased to say Knight’s certainly demonstrated very high standards and,
of course, great fish and chips.”

Bill has been active in the Conservation Society for many years. He has
rescued memorabilia and artifacts that could otherwise have been lost.
He feels strongly that Northload carpark should be properly signed off
the relief road as the new gateway to Glastonbury. This should have
happened as planned after the relief road.
