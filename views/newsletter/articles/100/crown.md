Three decades after the Glastonbury Conservation Society was founded to
save it, the 16th-century Crown Hotel, in the heart of the Market Place,
not only survives but is thriving.

For the past four years it has been the Glastonbury Backpackers:
dormitories for young travellers for as little as £10 a night — an idea
borrowed from Australia, and now a network across Britain.

The Crown even has the only sushi restaurant this side of Bath, with
delivery service ([83 3353](tel:+441458833353), and sushi does not mean raw fish, it simply
means “with rice”).

After all that, it’s only appropriate that we sign up Ben Butterell,
proprietor, as a member of the Conservation Society (with photographic
evidence).

Update, 2005
------------

Since the above item was printed, The Backpackers has painted itself
blue, and its overnight fees have gone up a bit (dorms start at £12).
The sushi restaurant proved too exotic for deepest Somerset; it’s now
the Pax Lunch sandwich bar and internet café, and the menu can be
downloaded.

Update, 2018
------------

Ben Butterell sold the business and moved away about 2010. The
Backpackers continued for a few years. By 2015 the building — still the
Crown — needed serious repairs, including the roof, and was eventually
boarded up for many months. The property, a listed building, was by then
owned by a national brewery chain, who at last carried out statutory
repairs. Sadly, though, the Crown is still boarded up, apparently
awaiting a tenant.
