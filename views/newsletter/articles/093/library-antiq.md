After the Antiquarian Society’s AGM on November 19 its president, Lady
Elizabeth Gass, will be joined by the county librarian, Robert Froud, in
an evening devoted to considering the new Glastonbury library to be
built in Archers Way. Of particular interest is the accommodation that
will be available for the Antiquarian Society’s collection and the study
facilities that will enable researchers to access material stored
elsewhere.

<img src="../library.png" alt="A line-art drawing of a building. It is two storeys high and appears to be clad in horizontal wood slats. The corner closest to the viewer has glass doors and windows stretching all the way up to the roof. On an adjacent wall is a sign reading “library”. The ground floor has a large circular window on each end of one wall of the building, as well as tall rectangular ones between. The roof has a shallow slope. Some figures stand nearby for scale.">

The drawing shows a view of the library entrance and, above it, the
Social Services offices. In the foreground are the existing telephone
kiosks opposite Butts Close, and between them and the library is the
short lane that gives access to the rear of St John’s churchyard and St
John’s schoolyard.

A scheme is at present being considered whereby the church allows
pedestrian access during daytime library hours along this lane to the
schoolyard and alongside the churchyard to the High Street, coming out
by the newsagent.
