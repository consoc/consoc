Glastonbury is one of the 100 towns in Britain listed in the
government’s plan to regenerate town centres, boost business and improve
infrastructure. For each town £25 million is on offer; the town must
present viable and ambitious schemes.

“But time is not on our side,” said Ian Tucker, the town council’s
delegate on the Town Deal board. “We must put together a plan by the end
of July. People really need to think about what we could take forward to
the Town Deal board.”

A special meeting of the town council on **Tuesday March 3** will work
on “new out-of-the-box thinking.”

Ian said: “The reason Glastonbury has got the money is that we have one
of the most deprived wards in the country. So whatever we bring forward
has to make a difference for us all.

“In Glastonbury we tend to do things differently from other parts of the
country. Something green would accord with the new mood in the land.
What we need people to come forward with are schemes that are
self-sustaining, or — even better — that generate a surplus that could
be reinvested in the town.”

The Town Deal board here will have 12 to 15 seats, most of them
non-Glastonians. “So it seems to me it’s going to have to be Glastonbury
people that come up with ideas,” Ian said.

Statutory bodies each have a seat — district and county councils, Member
of Parliament, the Heart of Southwest Local Enterprise Partnership,
education (Katie Quinn, principal of Strode College), and Department of
Work and Pensions (Lucy Martin). Current advertisements invite business
representatives — youth, health, environmental (deadline **noon Feb
21**).

Glastonians so far are Ian Tucker, Jill Barker (Chamber of Commerce
chair) and Jacqueline Cross (NHS).

The chairman is yet to be chosen. James Heappey MP as vice-chairman
meanwhile holds the reins. The chairman has to be a businessman. Various
people are encouraging Ian Tucker to stand.

Bridgwater is the only other Somerset town on the Nov 1 government list
of 100. Like Glastonbury, Bridgwater lost its traditional employment in
the 1980s.

The Somerset Building Preservation Trust — of which our society is a
corporate member — is trying to find ways to increase the community use
of the historic Bishop’s Barn, in Silver Street, Wells. It is listed
Grade I.

A number of studies have been carried out with SBPT and partner
organizations, and these are now being considered by the Wells
Recreation Ground Trust.

Mendip District Council is the sole trustee of the Bishop’s Barn;
[see their article on the subject](https://www.mendip.gov.uk/article/6732/The-Bishop-s-Barn-Bandstand-and-Wells-Recreation-Ground).
There is also [a Wikipedia article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bishop's_Barn%2C_Wells).

The SBPT’s September newsletter can be downloaded from [its
website](http://sbpt.info).

John Brunsdon, our society’s president, has stepped down from the SBPT
committee; he was a founding member. At its annual general meeting on
October 8, the SBPT chairman, Russell Lillford, thanked Mr Brunsdon
“wholeheartedly” for the work he has done for the trust over many years.
