## Somerset heritage

## Local history

- [Glastonbury Antiquarian Society]() has an extensive site, with details of its meetings, as well as archives and pictures of the town and its features, including a town trail and the Lake Village.

- [Adam Stout](https://glastonburysite.wordpress.com/talks/the-onset-of-avalon/) is starting to put his talks and papers about Glastonbury history online. One treatise covers pioneer attempts to preserve our heritage buildings, and the precursors of the “Avalonians” here, G.W. Wright among them.

- [Past pupils of St Louis convent school](http://stlouisconvent.co.uk/) in Magdalene Street, now converted to four large dwellings, have set up a website of reminiscences and history.

## Dissolution

One neighbouring society, sad to say, held its last meeting in January 2019 and dissolved because volunteers could not be found to fill vacancies on its committee:

- The Street Society — our neighbour, two miles west of Glastonbury.
  The Street Society was founded in 2001.
